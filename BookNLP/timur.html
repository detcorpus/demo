<p/>It was all of three months since Colonel Alexandrov, the commanding officer of an
<p/>armoured unit, left home. Presumably, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) unit. In the middle of the
<p/>summer he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sent a wire home advising his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) daughters Olga and Jenny to rent a cottage
<p/>in the country near Moscow and to spend the rest of their vacation there.

<p/>Jenny stood leaning on the handle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) broom in front of Olga, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) print head-
<p/>scarf pushed back, and scowled as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sister issued instructions:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll take the things down in a lorry and you clean up the flat. It's no use frowning
<p/>and pouting. When you leave, lock the door. Return the books to the library. Don't go
<p/>dropping in to say good-bye to all your girl friends but go straight to the station. From
<p/>there you will send Daddy this telegram. Then take the train and come straight to the
<p/>villa. Jenny, you must do as I tell you. After all, I'm your sister...''

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm yours.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quite right, but I'm older than you -- and besides, it's what Dad told us to do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>When Jenny heard the engine of the lorry start up in the yard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) heaved a sigh and
<p/>glanced around the room. Complete disorder met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) went up to the dusty
<p/>mirror in which was reflected the portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) father on the opposite wall.

<p/>All right, then! Granted Olga was older and had to be obeyed for the time being!
<p/>But it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>), Jenny, who had her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) father's nose and mouth and eyebrows. And, most
<p/>likely, it would turn out to be she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) who had inherited his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) character too.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) tightened the knot of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) kerchief, kicked off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sandals and picked up a
<p/>duster. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) whisked the cloth off the table, set a pail under the tap, grabbed the
<p/>broom and swept a pile of rubbish toward the door.

<p/>Soon the oil stove was spluttering and the primus buzzing. The floor was flooded
<p/>with water. Soapsuds frothed in the zinc washtub.

<p/>And, outside, passers-by gaped up at a barefoot girl in a red sun-dress standing
<p/>fearlessly on a third-floor windowsill cleaning a wide-open window.



<p/>The lorry sped along the broad, sun-flooded road. Olga sat in the back in a wicker
<p/>chair, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) feet on a suitcase and leaning against a soft bundle. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) lap a
<p/>reddish-yellow kitten was playing with a bunch of cornflowers.

<p/>At the 20th milepost they were overtaken by a motorised column. The soldiers, who
<p/>sat in rows on wooden benches, the muzzles of their rifles pointed skyward, were
<p/>singing lustily.

<p/>At the sound of the singing the doors and windows of j cottages were thrown wide
<p/>open. Excited children tumbled out over fences and through gates. They waved and
<p/>cheered, throwing the men half-ripe apples, and before the column disappeared from
<p/>view started games of soldiers, cutting their way through thick tangles of weeds and
<p/>nettles in dashing cavalry charges.

<p/>The lorry turned off into a sprawling holiday estate and came to a stop in front of a
<p/>small wooden house with ivy-covered walls. The driver and his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) assistant let down the
<p/>sideboards and began to unload. Olga opened the door of the glassed-in porch.

<p/>From here there was a view of a rambling, neglected garden. At the farther end of
<p/>the garden stood a ramshackle two-storey shed flying a small red flag.

<p/>Olga returned to the lorry. Here, a spry old lady, the milkwoman from next door,
<p/>popped up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) elbow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) had come to offer to scrub out the cottage and to clean
<p/>the windows.




<p/>While the neighbour was making ready her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) mops and pails, Olga picked up the
<p/>kitten and strolled out into the garden.

<p/>Warm blobs of resin glistened on the trunks of the cherry trees. A pungent aroma of
<p/>currants, moon daisies and wormwood filled the air. The mossy roof of the shed was
<p/>full of holes, and through these holes taut strings ran out and disappeared into the
<p/>foliage of the nearby trees. Olga pushed through a clump of hazels, and paused to
<p/>brush a cobweb from her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) face.

<p/>What was that? The red flag was gone from the pole on the roof of the shed.

<p/>Now Olga caught the sound of rapid, anxious whispering. Suddenly, the heavy
<p/>ladder propped up against the window of the loft toppled over, breaking some dry
<p/>branches in its fall and crushing the burdock as it thumped against the ground.

<p/>The taut strings leading out through the roof began to quiver. The frightened kitten
<p/>scratched Olga's hands as it somersaulted into the nettles. Bewildered, Olga stopped,
<p/>glanced around and listened intently. But neither up the trees, nor beyond the fence,
<p/>nor behind the dark window of the loft was there anything to be seen or to be heard.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) returned to the porch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``ft's them children up to their tricks again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>the milk-woman informed Olga.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yesterday they shook all the apples off two trees in our neighbour's garden, and
<p/>broke some branches off a pear tree too. Awful brats they are -- regular hoodlums. I
<p/>saw my boy off to the Army the other day, dearie. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't so much as touch a drop
<p/>before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went. `Good-bye, Mum,' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says, and off he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) goes whistling, the darling.
<p/>Towards evening 1 began to feel sorry for myself, like one does, and so I had a good
<p/>cry. I woke up in the night feeling as if somebody was snooping around in the yard.
<p/>`Well,' I says to myself, `here I am all alone in the world now, with not a soul to stand

<p/>up for me ' It doesn't take much to finish off an old woman like me, you know. A

<p/>knock on the head with a brick -- and that's the end of me. God was merciful, though,
<p/>and nothing was stolen. They snooped and scratched around a bit and then they made
<p/>off. I had a barrel standing in the yard -- made out of oak it is, takes three men to shift
<p/>it -- well, this barrel had been shoved off all of twenty yards towards the gate. And
<p/>that's all the story. Who it was and what they wanted I have no idea!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>At twilight, when the house was all cleaned and tidied, Olga stepped out onto the
<p/>porch. Carefully, she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) took a white accordion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) father's birthday gift, from its leather
<p/>case, placed it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) knee, fastened the strap over her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) shoulder and began to pick out
<p/>the tune of a song she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) had recently heard:

<p/>Ah, if only just this once

<p/>You would come back safe to me!

<p/>Ah, if only just this -- once...

<p/>And the next time...

<p/>And again...

<p/>But you'll never understand

<p/>Flying fast above the land

<p/>How long and slow the waiting for your plane!

<p/>Ah!

<p/>Airmen all and pilots! Bombers all and fighters!

<p/>Now you've taken off for far away.

<p/>When will you come back to me?




<p/>I cannot tell when it will be.

<p/>Only -- come back! Any time -- on any day... .



<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sang Olga glanced up warily every now and again at a dark clump of bushes
<p/>near the fence.

<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) rose abruptly, faced the bushes and said in a loud voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here! Why are you hiding there and what do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>A man in an ordinary white suit emerged from behind the bushes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<p/>head and replied politely:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not hiding. I'm a bit of a singer myself. I didn't want to disturb you so I stood
<p/>and listened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but you could have stood and listened from the road. Why did you have to
<p/>climb over the fence?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me? Climb over the fence?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man was obviously offended. <div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon,
<p/>but I'm not a cat. There's a gap in the fence over there, and I squeezed through it.'''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga ironically. <div class="bookquote">``Over there, however, is the gate. Perhaps you will be
<p/>good enough to squeeze back into the street through it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man did as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was told. Without a word he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked through the gate and bolted
<p/>it behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). This pleased Olga.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) called, coming down the steps. <div class="bookquote">``Did you say you were a
<p/>singer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``I'm an engineer, but in my spare time I sing in the operatic society
<p/>at our works.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga suggested suddenly as though it were the most natural thing in the
<p/>world. <div class="bookquote">``Would you mind seeing me to the station? I'm expecting my younger sister.
<p/>It's quite late and dark already and there's no sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). I'm not afraid of anyone, but I
<p/>don't know my way around here yet. Wait a moment, though! What are you opening
<p/>the gate for? You can wait for me outside!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) put the accordion away, threw a shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shoulders and stepped out into
<p/>the dark street that was scented with dew and flowers.



<p/>Olga hardly spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) companion because she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) was angry with Jenny. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) name was George Garayev and that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) worked at a motor works.

<p/>Two trains went by, and still no Jenny. Then the third and last train came and went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't imagine the trouble that kid causes me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``If I were
<p/>forty, or at least thirty, then it would be different. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'s thirteen and I'm eighteen,
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) just won't do anything I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No need to be forty!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>George said firmly. <div class="bookquote">``Eighteen's much better! And there's
<p/>nothing to worry about: your sister'll come tomorrow morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The platform emptied out. George took out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cigarette case, and at once two
<p/>tough-looking youngsters swaggered up to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), cigarettes in hand, and stood waiting
<p/>for a light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Young man,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>said George, striking a match and holding it close to the older boy's
<p/>face. <div class="bookquote">``Before asking for a light you ought to say `hello'. I've already had the honour of
<p/>making your acquaintance in the park where you were so diligently pulling a board out
<p/>of a new fence. Your name's Mikhail Kvakin, isn't it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy backed away. George blew out the match and offered Olga his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arm to walk
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) home.




<p/>When they were out of earshot the second boy stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soiled cigarette behind his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
<p/>ear and drawled:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's that agitator? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from hereabouts?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Uh-hu,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin said wryly. <div class="bookquote">``That's Timur Garayev's uncle. We ought to get hold
<p/>of Timur and punch his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) nose for him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)'s gone and got a gang together and it looks
<p/>like they're out to get us.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>Just then the boys caught sight of an old gentleman under the lamp-post at the end
<p/>of the platform. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was walking down the steps leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stick.

<p/>The man was Doctor Kolokolchikov, a local resident. They rushed after him (<font color='blue'><b>Kolokolchikov</b></font>) asking
<p/>loudly for matches. The old gentleman did not seem to like their looks or their
<p/>manners, for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) turned round and brandished his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gnarled stick at them. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
<p/>continued sedately on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way.



<p/>Jenny did not have time to send the wire to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) father from the station in Moscow,
<p/>so when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) got off the train she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) decided to look for the local post office.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sauntered through an old park, gathering harebells, and did not notice how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
<p/>came out to a crossing of two roads bounded by gardens. The deserted appearance of
<p/>the place clearly indicated that this was not the part of the estate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) had been
<p/>looking for.

<p/>Not far away she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) saw a small, agile girl who was pulling a stubborn goat along by
<p/>the horns and cursing it roundly in the process.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey, will you tell me the way to the post office please?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny called out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>).

<p/>But just then the goat wrenched free, tossed its horns and started across the park at a
<p/>gallop with the wailing girl in hot pursuit. Jenny looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>): dusk was falling
<p/>and not a soul in sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) opened a gate at random and walked up the path to the
<p/>porch of a grey, two-storey villa.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you please tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny addressed the closed door in a loud but very polite
<p/>voice, <div class="bookquote">``how to get from here to the post office?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) stood there for a while thinking, then opened the door,
<p/>entered the hall and walked into a room. Nobody seemed to be at home. Feeling rather
<p/>guilty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) turned to go out again but was brought up short by the noiseless appearance
<p/>of a large, tawny dog from under the table. The dog studied the flustered girl for
<p/>several moments and then, with a low growl, draped itself across the threshold.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't be silly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny cried, spreading out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) fingers in fear. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not a burglar! I
<p/>haven't taken anything! Look, this is the key to our flat, and this is the telegram for
<p/>Dad. My father's an officer, understand?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The dog</b></font>)</div><p/>The dog did not stir. Jenny, edging her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) way surreptitiously toward the open
<p/>window, went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See? Just you stay where you are. You're a nice doggie, so clever and sweet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>But the moment Jenny touched the windowsill the sweet doggie leapt up with such
<p/>a snarl that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) took a flying leap onto the sofa and sat there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) legs tucked up
<p/>underneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a nice one,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) said, on the verge of tears. <div class="bookquote">``You go ahead and catch
<p/>burglars and spies, if you like, but I'm a -- I'm a human being. Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) stuck out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
<p/>tongue at the dog and added: <div class="bookquote">``Idiot!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny put the key and telegram on the edge of the table near the sofa. There was
<p/>nothing to do but to wait for the owners of the house.




<p/>One hour passed, and then another. ... It grew quite dark. Through the open
<p/>window drifted the whistling of distant trains, the barking of dogs and the thud of a
<p/>volleyball. Somewhere, someone was strumming a guitar. Only here, in the grey villa,
<p/>everything was desolate and still.

<p/>Jenny propped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) head against the hard arm-rest of the sofa and began to cry
<p/>quietly. In the end, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) fell fast asleep.



<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) awoke it was already morning.

<p/>The luxuriant rain-washed foliage rustled in the wind outside the window. A pump
<p/>handle creaked nearby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could hear the rasping of a saw. But inside the villa it was
<p/>as quiet as before.

<p/>Jenny found that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) head was now resting on a soft leather cushion and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) legs
<p/>had been covered with a sheet. The dog was gone.

<p/>That must mean somebody had been here during the night!

<p/>Jenny sprang up, tossed back her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hair, straightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) crumpled frock, picked up
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) key and the unsent telegram and was about to make off when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) noticed a slip of
<p/>paper on the table. On it was written in large letters with a blue pencil:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you leave see you give the door a good bang.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The note was signed <div class="bookquote">``Timur'' (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>Timur? Who was Timur? She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) ought to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) and thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) took a look into the next room. Here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) saw a desk with a writing set, an
<p/>ashtray and a small mirror on it. To the right lay a battered old revolver, and a pair of
<p/>leather driving gloves. Propped against the desk was a curved Turkish sabre in a
<p/>scratched and much worn scabbard. Jenny put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) key and telegram, touched the
<p/>sabre, drew it out of its scabbard and, brandishing the naked blade above her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) head,
<p/>observed the effect in the mirror.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) appearance was quite formidable. It would be wonderful to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) picture
<p/>taken that way and then show it around at school! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) father had
<p/>once taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) to the front with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The revolver would look better still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) left
<p/>hand. Like this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) knitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) brows as far as they would go, compressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) lips,
<p/>aimed at the mirror and pressed the trigger.

<p/>The room rang with a deafening report. A cloud of smoke veiled the windows. The
<p/>mirror fell on top of the ashtray. Forgetting the key and telegram on the desk, Jenny
<p/>shot out of the room and fled from this weird and dangerous house as fast as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) legs
<p/>could carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>).



<p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) knew it she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) found herself at the bank of a stream. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) had neither
<p/>the key to their flat, nor the telegram, nor a receipt for the telegram. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
<p/>would have to tell Olga everything: about the dog, about sleeping in the empty villa,
<p/>about the Turkish sabre, and, finally, about the shot. What rotten luck! If Dad were
<p/>there he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) would understand. But Olga wouldn't. Olga would be cross or, even worse,
<p/>would cry. And that would be awful. Jenny could cry too -- when in the mood. But
<p/>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) saw Olga in tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) always felt like taking refuge on top of a telegraph
<p/>pole or a tall tree or a chimney.

<p/>Jenny had a swim to cheer herself up and then went slowly off in search of their
<p/>house.




<p/>Olga was in the kitchen starting up the primus when Jenny mounted the steps of the
<p/>porch. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) heard the footsteps she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) swung around and fixed Jenny with a mute,
<p/>hostile gaze.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Olga!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>said Jenny, stopping short on the top step and forcing a smile. <div class="bookquote">``Olga,
<p/>you won't scold me, will you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I certainly will!'' (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>' Olga retorted without shifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) gaze from Jenny's face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, do scold me then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny said meekly. <div class="bookquote">``If you only knew what a strange
<p/>adventure I've had! Olga, please don't twitch your eyebrows; nothing terrible's
<p/>happened. I only lost the key to the flat and didn't send off the wire to Dad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny shut up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) eyes, gulped and got set to tell the whole story in one breath.

<p/>But just then the front gate flew open with a bang and a shaggy goat covered with
<p/>burs came charging in with lowered horns, followed closely by the wailing barefoot
<p/>girl whom Jenny had met the previous day.

<p/>Seizing the opportunity to postpone the ticklish explanation Jenny dashed into the
<p/>garden to chase out the goat.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) overtook the panting girl just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) had got a grip on the goat's horns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you lost anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the girl asked rapidly through clenched teeth without
<p/>pausing in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) immediate occupation of kicking and pummeling the goat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny replied, puzzled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then whose is this? Not yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The girl showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) the key to the Moscow flat.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>whispered Jenny, glancing apprehensively back at the porch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, take the key, this note and the receipt. Your telegram's already been sent,''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>said the girl, still speaking quickly through clenched teeth.

<p/>Then, thrusting a small paper package into Jenny's hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) struck the goat with
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) clenched fist.

<p/>The animal bolted toward the gate, and the barefoot girl darted after it, heading
<p/>straight through a patch of thorns and stinging nettles. They shot out of the gate and
<p/>were gone.

<p/>Jenny opened the package, hunching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) shoulders as though it were she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) and not the
<p/>goat who had taken a beating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's the key. And a receipt for the telegram. That means somebody sent it off.
<p/>But who? Ah, this must be the note. What does it all mean?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The note, written in large letters with a blue pencil, read:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No need to be afraid of anyone at home. Everything's fine and I won't tell.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was
<p/>signed <div class="bookquote">``Timur'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>As if in a trance, Jenny quietly tucked the note into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) pocket. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) squared
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) shoulders and calmly went back to Olga.

<p/>Olga was still standing in the same place by the unlit primus, her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) eyes brimming
<p/>with tears.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Olya!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny cried remorsefully. <div class="bookquote">``I was only joking. Don't be cross with me! I
<p/>cleaned the whole flat and the windows too. I really worked hard. I washed all the
<p/>dusters and scrubbed the floors. Here's the key and here's the receipt for Dad's wire.
<p/>Now let me give you a kiss -- you know how much I love you! Want me to jump from
<p/>the roof into the nettle patch for you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>Without waiting for Olga to reply, Jenny hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes -- but I was so worried,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga said in desperation. <div class="bookquote">``You're always making
<p/>the most pointless jokes. And Dad told me -- stop it, Jenny! Jenny, for goodness' sake,
<p/>my hands are all covered with kerosene! Look, Jenny, suppose you pour some milk
<p/>into the saucepan and put it on the stove to boil.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I -- I can't help making jokes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny muttered while Olga walked over to the
<p/>washstand.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) placed the pot of milk on the primus, felt for the note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) pocket, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Olga, does God exist?''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>replied Olga, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) face to the faucet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, who is it up there, then?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga exclaimed impatiently. <div class="bookquote">``There isn't anybody!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny was silent for a moment and then resumed:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Olga, who is Timur?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)'s not God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a king,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>replied Olga grudgingly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) soaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) hands and
<p/>face. <div class="bookquote">``A cruel, lame king out of the Middle Ages.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><

<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if this Timur isn't a king and isn't cruel and isn't out of the Middle Ages, then
<p/>who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case I don't know. Leave me alone! What's all this about Timur anyway?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because I have a kind of feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)'s a person I love very much indeed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga raised an incredulous, lathered face. <div class="bookquote">``What nonsense are you
<p/>talking? Why must you always be making things up? Why can't you let me wash in
<p/>peace! Just wait till Dad comes home. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'ll see about this love of yours!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>), how?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny cried with feeling. <div class="bookquote">``Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) does come, it won't be for
<p/>long. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) certainly wouldn't mistreat anybody so lonely and defenceless.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's lonely and defenceless?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga asked in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``You? Oh, Jenny, I really
<p/>don't know what to make of you; I can't imagine who you take after!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny lowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) head. Staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) reflection on the nickel-plated surface of the
<p/>tea kettle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) replied proudly and without hesitation:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``After Dad. Just Dad. Him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) and him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) only. And after no one else in the world.''



 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The elderly gentleman, Doctor Kolokolchikov, was sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) garden tinkering
<p/>with a wall clock.

<p/>In front of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grandson Nick with a doleful expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face.

<p/>Nick was supposed to be helping his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) grandfather. Actually, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) had been
<p/>holding a screwdriver in readiness for more than an hour, waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) grandfather
<p/>to ask for it.

<p/>But the steel spring which had to be pressed back into place was proving stubborn,
<p/>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) grandfather was very patient. And it seemed there would be no end to Nick's
<p/>waiting. It was just too silly, especially since Sima Siniakov's tousled head had already
<p/>bobbed up several times over the fence, and Sima was a fellow who always knew
<p/>everything that was going on. And this same Sima was making such strange and
<p/>mysterious signs at Nick with his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) tongue, head and hands that even Nick's five-year-
<p/>old sister Tata, who was sitting under a linden tree trying to stuff a bur into the mouth
<p/>of a sprawling dog, suddenly let out a scream and jerked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) grandfather by the
<p/>trousers. At this Sima Simakov's head instantly disappeared.

<p/>At long last the spring was properly installed. <div class="bookquote">``Man must toil,''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>observed the grey-
<p/>haired gentleman Kolokolchikov raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Kolokolchikov</b></font>) moist forehead and addressing Nick.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've no call to look as though I'd been giving you a dose of castor oil. Give me the
<p/>screwdriver and take the pliers. Toil is ennobling. And nobility of character is just
<p/>what you lack, my boy. Yesterday, for example, you had four helpings of ice cream
<p/>and didn't share any with your little sister.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s lying, the shameless little brute!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div>cried Nick indignantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) glared at Tata. <div class="bookquote">``I
<p/>let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) have two bites three times. And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) goes and tells on me and takes four kopeks
<p/>off Mum's table as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) goes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you climbed out of the window on a rope last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Tata announced
<p/>imperturbably, without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``And you've got a torch under your pillow.
<p/>And yesterday a bad boy threw stones through our bedroom window. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kept on and
<p/>on -- throwing stones and whistling, throwing stones and whistling.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div><p/>Nick gasped at this base treachery on the part of the shameless Tata. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) began to
<p/>tremble from head to foot. Fortunately his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) grandfather was too occupied to pay
<p/>attention to such dangerous slander, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) simply had not heard. Luckily, too, the
<p/>milkwoman came into the garden with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) cans at that moment. Pouring out the milk,
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) lamented:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you imagine, dear doctor, some burglars got into the yard and tried to steal my
<p/>oak barrel last night! And people say that two fellows were seen on my roof early this
<p/>morning: sitting on the chimney, mind you, and dangling their legs, the scoundrels.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``On the chimney? Why should they do that, pray?''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>inquired the puzzled gentleman.

<p/>But at that moment an ear-splitting clanging and jangling issued from the chicken
<p/>coop. The screwdriver jolted in the old gentleman's hand and the capricious spring
<p/>took advantage of this opportunity to pop out and hit the roof with a bang. Everybody,
<p/>even Tata and the lazy dog, spun round at once, wondering what it could be. Without
<p/>uttering a word Nick scampered off across the carrot patch like a hare and disappeared
<p/>behind the fence.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) halted near a cow byre from which, as from the chicken coop, was issuing the
<p/>sound of sharp, clanging blows; it sounded as if somebody were hitting a section of
<p/>steel rail with a hammer. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) ran into Sima Simakov and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) excitedly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, what's up? Is that the alarm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No! I reckon it's No. 1 general rallying signal.''

 (<font color='red'><b>a chap</b></font>)</div><p/>They scaled the fence and dived through a hole in the paling of the park, where they
<p/>bumped into a sturdy, broad-shouldered chap named Geika. Vasili Ladygin showed up
<p/>next, and after him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) several others. Swiftly and noiselessly they sped toward their
<p/>`destination along paths known to them alone, exchanging clipped phrases as they ran:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that the alarm?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nope. It's No. 1 general rally.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What rally? This isn't `three-stop, three-stop'. It's some lunatic wheeling off ten at a
<p/>time!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, we'll see.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure, we'll check up!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on! Full speed ahead!''



 (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div><p/>As all this was going on, a tall, dark-haired boy of about thirteen was standing in
<p/>the living-room of the villa where Jenny had spent the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was wearing black
<p/>trousers and a dark blue sleeveless shirt with a red star embroidered in front.

<p/>A shaggy, grey-haired old man came in. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coarse linen shirt was threadbare and
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) baggy trousers were covered with patches. A roughly made wooden leg was
<p/>strapped to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left knee. In one hand he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held a piece of paper, and in the other he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
<p/>clutching a battered old revolver. ; <div class="bookquote">``

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>`When you leave see you give the door a good bang, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read out derisively. <div class="bookquote">``Well,
<p/>perhaps you'll let me know who slept here on the sofa last night?''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A girl I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>the boy replied reluctantly. <div class="bookquote">``I wasn't at home and the dog wouldn't
<p/>let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) leave.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a lie!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man testily. <div class="bookquote">``If you knew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) you'd have written her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
<p/>name on the note.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``When I wrote it I didn't know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name. Now I do.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You didn't know it? And you went off in the morning leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) all by herself?
<p/>My dear boy, you're obviously not a hundred per cent, and it's high time you were put
<p/>in the loony bin. That good-for-nothing girl broke the mirror and chipped the ashtray.
<p/>It was a good thing the revolver was charged with blanks. What if they had been real
<p/>bullets?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Uncle -- you don't keep real bullets, because your enemies' sabres and rifles
<p/>are -- only wood, after all.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>A suggestion of a smile flitted across the old man's face. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tossed back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<p/>shaggy head and said sternly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better look out! I notice everything, I can see you're up to some monkey business,
<p/>and if you don't take care I'll send you back to your mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man stumped upstairs. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone the boy jumped up, grabbed
<p/>the front paws of the dog, which came trotting in just then, and kissed it on the nose.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Rita! We didn't get away with it, this time! It's okay, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s in a good
<p/>mood today. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll start singing in a minute.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And that was exactly what happened. The old man upstairs cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat, let
<p/>out a trial tra-la-la, and then began to sing in a low baritone:

<p/>Three nights I've kept my wearing watch. I peer
<p/>Into the dismal dark and always seem to hear
<p/>Muffled, suspicious sounds...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop that, you mad dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Timur cried. <div class="bookquote">``You'll tear my trousers! Where are you
<p/>trying to drag me?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment later, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) slammed the door of the staircase leading up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)
<p/>uncle's room and raced the dog down the hallway and out onto the veranda. In a corner
<p/>of the veranda, near a small telephone, a little bronze bell attached to a cord was
<p/>jerking and banging against the wall.

<p/>The boy put his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand over the bell and wound the cord around a nail. Then the cord
<p/>stopped jerking and slackened -- it had probably broken somewhere along the line.
<p/>Angry and baffled, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) picked up the receiver.

<p/>An hour earlier, Olga had been sitting at a table with a physics textbook before her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>).

<p/>Jenny had come in and picked up a little bottle of iodine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga had said severely. <div class="bookquote">``How did you come by that scratch on your
<p/>shoulder?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I was walking along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny answered carelessly, <div class="bookquote">``and something prickly or
<p/>sharp got in my way. That's how it happened.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why doesn't anything prickly or sharp get in my way?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga mocked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, it does! There's a maths exam in your way. That's both prickly and sharp.
<p/>Watch out you don't get scratched! Olya, don't you be an engineer, be a doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny
<p/>chattered on, shoving a small mirror in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sister's face. <div class="bookquote">``Just take a look at
<p/>yourself: what sort of an engineer would you make? An engineer ought to be like
<p/>this -- this -- and this.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) made three faces.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``And you look like this -- this -- and
<p/>this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny rolled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) eyes, arched her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) eyebrows and smiled sweetly.




<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga said, hugging and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) sister and then gently pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away, Jenny, and don't bother me. You'd be more useful if you fetched some
<p/>water from the well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny took an apple from a plate and retreated to a corner, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) stood gazing
<p/>out of the window for several minutes. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) opened the accordion case and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know what, Olya? Someone came up to me today -- not bad-looking, blond,
<p/>white suit -- and said, `What's your name, little girl?' `Jenny,' I said.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny, stop bothering me and leave that instrument alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga said without
<p/>turning round or raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) eyes from the book.

<p/>'' `And your sister's name,' '' Jenny continued, tugging at the accordion, '' `is Olga, I
<p/>believe?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny, stop bothering me and leave that instrument alone!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga repeated,
<p/>beginning to listen in spite of herself.

<p/>'' `Your sister plays very well,' he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) said. `Does she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) intend to study at the
<p/>Conservatory?' '' -LRB-Jenny was dragging the accordion out of its case and fixing the strap
<p/>over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) shoulder.-RRB- '' `No,' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>). `She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'s specialising in reinforced concrete.' Then
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) said, `Oh!''' -LRB-Jenny pressed one of the keys.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``So I said, `Boo!' ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Jenny pressed
<p/>another key.-RRB-

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You horrid child! Put that instrument back at once!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga cried, jumping up. <div class="bookquote">``Who
<p/>gave you permission to speak to strange men?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, I'll put it away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny said huffily. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't me who spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Boo</b></font>). It
<p/>was he (<font color='blue'><b>Boo</b></font>) who spoke to me. I was going to tell you the rest, but now I won't. You just
<p/>wait till Dad comes home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'ll show you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me? It's you he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>)'ll show. You won't let me do any work.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny cried, picking up an empty pail and flying out onto the porch. <div class="bookquote">``I'll
<p/>tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) how you send me running for kerosene, soap and water a hundred times a
<p/>day! I'm not a lorry, or a horse, or a tractor either!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny brought in the pail of water and set it on a bench, but since Olga did not even
<p/>look up from the book, she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) went out into the garden, a pout on her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) face.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) strolled over to the little green clearing in front of the old two-storey shed, took
<p/>a sling out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) pocket and, stretching the rubber band, shot a tiny cardboard
<p/>parachutist up into the air.

<p/>Soaring upside down, the parachutist turned a somersault and a little blue paper
<p/>parachute popped open over his (<font color='blue'><b>parachutist</b></font>) head. But just then a gust of wind bore him (<font color='blue'><b>parachutist</b></font>) into the
<p/>blackness of the loft window.

<p/>A casualty! Something had to be done to save the little cardboard man. Jenny ran
<p/>round the shed, from the roof of which taut strings stretched in all directions. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) set
<p/>the rickety ladder back against the window, climbed it and jumped down onto the
<p/>floor of the loft.

<p/>How strange! The loft appeared to be inhabited! On one of the walls were hanging
<p/>some twists of twine, a lantern, two crossed signalling flags and a map of the locality
<p/>marked with mysterious signs. In a corner lay a pile of straw covered with sacking,
<p/>and an upturned soap box.

<p/>A large wheel that looked like a ship's helm was sticking out from the wall near the
<p/>mossy sieve of a roof. Above it hung a home-made telephone.

<p/>Jenny peered through a crack in the wall. Outside, the foliage of the overgrown
<p/>gardens stretched rippling like a sea and pigeons were frolicking in the sky. Jenny
<p/>decided to make the pigeons seagulls and the old shed with its ropes, lanterns and
<p/>flags -- a big ship. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'d be the captain.




<p/>It was great fun. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) turned the wheel. The taut strings had begun to vibrate and
<p/>hum, the wind whistled and whipped up the green waves. It seemed just as though her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
<p/><div class="bookquote">``ship''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were slewing slowly and majestically through the waves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helm to port!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) commanded loudly and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) weight on the heavy wheel.

<p/>Just then a few straight and narrow shafts of sunlight broke through the holes in the
<p/>roof and fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) face and frock. But Jenny understood that these rays were the
<p/>searchlights of enemy vessels trying to pick her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) out and decided to give battle.

<p/>Wrenching the creaking wheel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) manoeuvred to right and left, imperiously
<p/>rapping out her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) commands.

<p/>Soon the sharp searchlight beams paled and died out. That, of course, did not mean
<p/>that the sun had hidden behind a cloud. It meant that the routed enemy squadron was
<p/>going to the bottom.



<p/>The battle was over. Jenny wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) forehead with a dusty palm. Suddenly the
<p/>telephone rang. Jenny had not expected that -- she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) had thought it was a toy telephone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) began to feel uneasy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) picked up the receiver. A sharp voice came through.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hullo! Hullo! Who's there? Who's the silly ass who's breaking the wires and
<p/>sending out stupid, incomprehensible signals?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's not an ass,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny muttered in confusion. <div class="bookquote">``It's me, Jenny.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You crazy girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the voice exclaimed with a suggestion of very real anxiety. <div class="bookquote">``Leave
<p/>the wheel alone and run for your life! They'll come piling in at any moment and knock
<p/>your head off! ''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny dropped the receiver, but it was too late. A head popped through the
<p/>window -- Geika's -- and then Sima Simakov, Nick Kolokolchikov and the others all
<p/>tumbled in one after another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>asked Jenny, backing away from the window in fright. <div class="bookquote">``Go away!
<p/>This is our garden. I didn't ask you to come.''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>But a silent, compact wall of boys advanced shoulder to shoulder on Jenny.
<p/>Cornered, Jenny let out a scream.

<p/>At that moment yet another shadow darkened the window. The boys turned and
<p/>opened ranks, and Jenny found herself face to face with a tall, dark-haired boy in a
<p/>blue, sleeveless shirt with a red star embroidered in front.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Less noise, Jenny!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said loudly. <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't shout. No one's going to hurt you.
<p/>We know each other, you and me. I'm Timur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're Timur?!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Jenny incredulously, opening wide her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) tear-fdled eyes.
<p/>'' Y ou mean it was you who covered me with a sheet last night? Who left the note on
<p/>the table? Who sent off the wire to Dad and had the key and receipt brought to me?
<p/>But why did you do it? How do you know who I am?''

<p/>At this he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) came across to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>), took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hand and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'd better stay here with us now. Sit down and listen, and then you'll understand
<p/>everything.''



 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The boys settled themselves on the sack-covered straw around Timur, who had
<p/>spread out in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) the map of the estate.

<p/>A lookout was stationed on a rope swing suspended in front of a hole in the wall
<p/>above the window. From his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) neck dangled a pair of dented opera glasses.




<p/>Jenny sat not far from Timur and gave all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) attention to the proceedings of the
<p/>conference of this top-secret headquarters. Timur was speaking:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``At daybreak tomorrow, while everybody is still asleep, Kolokolchikov and I will
<p/>repair the lines she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Kolokolchikov</b></font>) pointed to Jenny-RRB- broke.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Kolokolchikov</b></font>)'ll oversleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>gloomily interjected the bullet-headed Geika, who was wearing a
<p/>striped sailor's jersey. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) only wakes up for breakfast and lunch.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's a 1-lie!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div>Nick jumped up and stuttered. <div class="bookquote">``I g-get up with the first r-ray of the
<p/>sun.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, I don't know which is the sun's first ray and which the second, but I do know
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>)'ll oversleep,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika retorted stubbornly.

<p/>At this juncture the lookout on the swing whistled. The boys sprang to their feet.

<p/>A mounted artillery battalion was galloping down the road in a cloud of dust. The
<p/>powerful horses, in heavy harness of leather and metal, were pulling along their green
<p/>ammunition wagons and tarpaulin-covered cannon at a spanking pace.

<p/>The sun-tanned, weather-beaten postilions took the bend in dashing style without
<p/>swaying in their saddles, and, one after another, the batteries disappeared into the
<p/>woods. Soon, the entire unit was out of sight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They're headed for the station to board a train,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div>Nick explained importantly. <div class="bookquote">``I can
<p/>tell by their uniforms. 1 can tell when they're out on drill, on parade, or on anything
<p/>else.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut!''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``We've
<p/>got eyes too. You know, boys, this windbag wants to run away to the Red Army!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can't do that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur intervened. <div class="bookquote">``It won't wash.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div>asked Nick, flushing. <div class="bookquote">``How come boys always used to run away to the
<p/>front?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was before! And now the officers and other bosses have strict orders to kick
<p/>out all the kids.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean, kick 'em out?''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div>cried Nick, turning a deeper red. <div class="bookquote">``You mean --
<p/>their own side?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur heaved a sigh. <div class="bookquote">``Their own side. And now, fellows, let's get
<p/>down to business.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The boys</b></font>)</div><p/>The boys resumed their places.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unidentified boys have been stealing apples from the garden of No. 34, Crooked
<p/>Lane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div>Nick announced sullenly. <div class="bookquote">``They broke two branches and trampled all over a
<p/>flower bed.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Whose house is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) notebook. <div class="bookquote">``It's Kryukov the soldier's.
<p/>Now, which of you is an ex-specialist on other people's gardens and apple trees?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>muttered an embarrassed voice.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who could have done this job?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kvakin and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) assistant, the chap they call Figure. They picked out a Michurin
<p/>tree; it grows Golden Sap apples.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That Kvakin again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur reflected a moment. <div class="bookquote">``Geika! Did you talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Got him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) on the jaw twice.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What'd he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) do?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) got me once or twice, too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All you can say is 'I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) got me.' And a fat lot of good it does! We'll
<p/>make Kvakin a special case. Next?''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The son of the old milkwoman who lives at No. 25 has been called up into the
<p/>cavalry,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>a boy in the comer reported.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some piece of news!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) head reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``We've had our sign on

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) climbed down the ladder and disappeared into the bushes. Now the lookout

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Shut up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>retorted Jenny derisively, jerking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sleeve free. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not having you

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Idly swinging a branch which he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) had broken off one of the trees, Timur was making
<p/>to cut across Kvakin's path.

<p/>Kvakin saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) and halted. His (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) vacant features registered neither surprise nor fear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hiya, Commissar!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Commissar</b></font>) said quietly, cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>Commissar</b></font>) head on one side. <div class="bookquote">``Where you off

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hiya, Chief!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur replied in the same tone. <div class="bookquote">``I was off to meet you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Glad to see you. Pity I haven't anything for you. Except this. .. .''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) fumbled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)
<p/>shirt and produced an apple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stolen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>asked Timur, biting into it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin said. <div class="bookquote">``Golden Sap. Only trouble is, it's not really ripe yet.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sour as vinegar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur made a face and tossed the apple away. <div class="bookquote">``Look here: did
<p/>you notice a sign like this on the fence of No. 34?''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur pointed to the star
<p/>embroidered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) blue shirt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, and what if I did?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) guard. <div class="bookquote">``Brother, I keep my eyes
<p/>peeled day and night.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then take my advice, and when you see this sign anywhere, day or night, run like a

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, Commissar, you're a bit of a fire-eater!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>drawled Kvakin. <div class="bookquote">``That'll do -- enough

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Say, Chief, you're a bit of a mule,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>answered Timur without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This is our last parley, so keep it in mind and pass it on to your gang.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div><p/>Nobody watching this scene would have thought that those two were anything but
<p/>the best of friends. So it was not surprising that Olga, standing at the gate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)
<p/>milk jug, should have asked the milkwoman whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) knew the boy who was
<p/>talking to that ruffian Kvakin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the milkwoman vehemently. <div class="bookquote">``I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>)'s just another one of
<p/>them hoodlums. I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) hanging around your house lately. Watch out they don't
<p/>go knocking your little sister about, dearie.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>Olga was disturbed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) shot a hostile glance at the two boys, walked back to the
<p/>porch, put away the jug of milk, locked the door and went out to look for Jenny, who
<p/>had not set foot in the house for more than two hours now.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) return to the loft Timur told the boys about his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) talk with Kvakin. They
<p/>decided to send the gang a written ultimatum the following day.

<p/>The boys climbed down noiselessly from the loft and ran back to their homes, some
<p/>crawling through gaps in the fences, others clambering over them.

<p/>Timur turned to Jenny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Is everything clear now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Absolutely,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``Only not quite. Make it simpler.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, but first climb down and follow me. Your sister isn't at home now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>When they reached the ground Timur gave the ladder a push and sent it toppling
<p/>over.

<p/>It was growing dark now, but Jenny followed Timur with complete confidence.

<p/>They halted at the old milkwoman's house. Timur glanced around. There was no
<p/>one in sight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) drew a tube of oil paint out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) pocket and went up to the gate. The
<p/>upper left-hand point of the red star drawn on it was indeed all wavy like a leech.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) straightened the line with a steady hand and tapered the point nicely.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you doing that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny asked. <div class="bookquote">``Please, tell me what it's all about.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>Timur put the tube back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) pocket, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) stained finger with a burdock leaf,
<p/>and, looking Jenny straight in the face, said:




<p/><div class="bookquote">``That star means a man living in this house has gone to the Army. And that from
<p/>now on this house is under our care and protection. Is your father in the Army?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>replied Jenny with pride and deep feeling. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s an officer.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That means you come under our care and protection too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They stopped at the gate of another cottage. There was a red star with a thick black
<p/>border here.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>said Timur. <div class="bookquote">``A man left this house for the Red Army, too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)'s dead.
<p/>This is Lieutenant Pavlov's house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlov</b></font>) was killed not long ago at the frontier. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlov</b></font>) wife
<p/>and little daughter live here -- and good old Geika wonders why the girl's always
<p/>crying. If you get a chance, Jenny, do something nice for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlov</b></font>) said all this very simply, but cold shivers ran down Jenny's back, though the
<p/>evening was quite warm.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) stood there silently, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) head bent. Just for the sake of saying something, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
<p/>asked: <div class="bookquote">``Is Geika really good?''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>said Timur. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) father is a sailor.

<p/>swank Kolokolchikov, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kolokolchikov</b></font>) always sticks up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Kolokolchikov</b></font>) just the same.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A peremptory, angry shout <div class="bookquote">``Jenny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>made them spin around. Olga was standing
<p/>quite close behind them.

<p/>Jenny touched Timur's hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) wanted to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) up to Olga and introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>).

<p/>But a second call, stern and cold, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) think again.

<p/>Nodding apologetically to Timur, and shrugging her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) shoulders in bewilderment,
<p/>Jenny walked over to Olga.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga, on the verge of tears, breathing heavily. <div class="bookquote">``I forbid you to talk to

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Olga, why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny muttered. <div class="bookquote">``What's wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forbid you to associate with that boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga repeated firmly. <div class="bookquote">``You're thirteen and
<p/>I'm eighteen. I'm your sister. I'm older than you. And when Dad left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) told me. ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But, Olga, you don't understand a thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny cried in despair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) was
<p/>trembling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) wanted to explain, to justify herself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) did not
<p/>have the right. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hand hopelessly and did not say another word.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) went straight home to bed, but sleep would not come for a long time. And after
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) fell asleep she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) did not hear someone knock on the window in the night and deliver
<p/>a telegram from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) father.



<p/>At daybreak the shepherd blew his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) wooden horn. The old milkwoman opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
<p/>gate and drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) cow out to join the herd on the common. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) had scarcely turned
<p/>the corner when five boys jumped out from behind an acacia shrub and scuttled over
<p/>to the well, trying not to make a clatter with their empty buckets.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pump it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's have it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>One after another, the boys rushed into the yard, cold water spilling on their bare
<p/>feet as they ran, emptied their buckets into the oak barrel and dashed back to the well.

<p/>Timur ran up to Sima Siniakov, who was wet from exertion and asked:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``See Kolokolchikov anywhere? No? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) has overslept. Hurry! The old
<p/>woman'll be back any minute.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Sima Siniakov/Sima/Siniakov</b></font>)</div><p/>Timur stole into the Kolokolchikovs' garden, stood under a tree and whistled.
<p/>Without waiting for an answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) climbed the tree and peered into the room. All he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)
<p/>could see from his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) perch was the end of a bed standing by the window and a pair of
<p/>blanket-covered legs.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) threw a piece of bark onto the bed and called softly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nick, get up! Nick!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The sleeper did not stir. Then Timur pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) pocket-knife, sliced off a long,
<p/>thin switch, sharpened the end and cast it into the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) hooked the blanket and
<p/>tugged.

<p/>The light blanket slipped out over the windowsill. A hoarse shout issued from the
<p/>room.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) sleepy eyes almost starting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) head, a grey-haired gentleman clad only in
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) pyjamas leapt from the bed and, grabbing the retreating blanket, rushed up to the
<p/>window.

<p/>Finding himself suddenly face to face with this venerable old man, Timur dropped
<p/>to the ground.

<p/>The old gentleman, however, flung the recaptured blanket onto his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bed, snatched his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
<p/>double-barrelled gun off the wall, hastily put on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles, poked the gun through
<p/>the window and, pointing the muzzle skyward, closed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes and fired.



<p/>Timur was so frightened that he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) did not stop running until he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) reached the well.
<p/>There had been a misunderstanding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) had taken the sleeper for Nick, and the old
<p/>gentleman had, naturally, taken him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for a burglar.

<p/>Just then Timur saw the milkwoman going through the gate with her (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) water buckets.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) dived behind a clump of acacias and settled down to observe what would
<p/>happen next.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) returned from the well, the old woman lifted a bucket and poured the
<p/>water into the barrel. The next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sprang aside, because the water splashed
<p/>back at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out of the already brimming barrel.

<p/>Gasping and peering round in bewilderment, the old woman inspected the barrel
<p/>from all sides. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plunged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand into the water and sniffed it. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hurried
<p/>over to the porch to see if the lock on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) door was in order. Then, finally, not
<p/>knowing what to think, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tapped at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neighbour's window.

<p/>Timur laughed and came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) hiding place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) had to hurry. The sun was
<p/>already rising. Nick had failed to turn up and the lines still had to be repaired.



<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) way through the garden to the shed, Timur glanced into an open
<p/>window which gave onto the garden.

<p/>Jenny, dressed in shorts and a polo shirt, was writing at a table near her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
<p/>kept tossing back her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hair impatiently from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) face.

<p/>When Jenny saw Timur, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) made no sign of alarm or surprise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) only motioned
<p/>to him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) not to wake Olga. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) unfinished letter into a drawer and tiptoed
<p/>out of the room.

<p/>When Jenny heard about Timur's morning misadventure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) forgot all Olga's
<p/>instructions and gladly volunteered to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) repair the lines which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) herself had
<p/>broken.

<p/>After they had finished the job and Timur was leaving, Jenny said:




<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why, but my sister absolutely hates you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>said Timur with chagrin. <div class="bookquote">``And my uncle feels the same way about
<p/>you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) was about to go but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute. You ought to comb your hair -- you look frightfully shaggy this
<p/>morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) got out her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) comb and was just handing it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) when Olga called out
<p/>indignantly from the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny! What are you doing?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the sisters</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment later the two sisters stood facing each other on the porch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't choose your friends for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny defended herself desperately. <div class="bookquote">``What
<p/>friends? Quite ordinary friends. In white suits. `Oh, how wonderfully your sister
<p/>plays!' Wonderfully! He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) ought to hear how wonderfully you scold! See this? I'm
<p/>writing all about everything to Dad!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny! That boy is a hoodlum and you're a little fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga coldly, trying to
<p/>keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) temper. <div class="bookquote">``Write to Dad if you like, but if I ever see you in that boy's company
<p/>again we're leaving here and going back to Moscow at once. And you know I keep my
<p/>word, don't you? ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes I do, you tyrant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>replied Jenny with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I know it all too well!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And now read this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) placed the telegram received the night before
<p/>on the table and went out.

<p/>The telegram read:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stopping in Moscow few hours en route. Will wire date and time later. Dad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) eyes, pressed the telegram to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) lips and murmured:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Daddy, please come soon! Dad, your Jenny isn't getting on too well!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Two cartloads of firewood were delivered to the house of the old woman who had
<p/>spanked the spry little Annie for losing the goat.

<p/>Grandma groaned and wheezed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) began to stack the logs, cursing the careless
<p/>drivers who had just dumped them all anyhow. The work was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>)
<p/>was seized with a coughing fit and sat down on the steps to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) breath. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>)
<p/>picked up a watering can and hobbled off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) vegetable garden. The only person
<p/>remaining in the yard was Annie's three-year-old brother, a young man of evident
<p/>energy and enterprise for, the moment Grandma was out of sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) picked up a stick
<p/>and began to beat out a tattoo on a bench and an upturned wash tub.

<p/>At this Sima Simakov, who had been hunting for the runaway goat -- which could
<p/>have vied with a Bengal tiger in bounding over bushes and across gullies -- left one of
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) men at the fringe of the wood and dashed into the yard at the head of the other
<p/>four.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stuffed a handful of wild strawberries into the youngster's mouth and stuck a
<p/>shiny crow's feather into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) squad began feverishly stacking the logs.

<p/>Sima Simakov himself ran off round the garden fence to detain Grandma in the
<p/>vegetable patch. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped at a place where a clump of cherry and apple trees grew
<p/>close up to the fence and peeped through a chink.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw that Grandma had gathered an apronful of cucumbers and was about to go
<p/>back.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tapped softly on the boards of the fence. Grandma gave a start. Then Sima
<p/>picked up a stick and began to stir the branches of an apple tree with it. Grandma




<p/>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) saw somebody climbing stealthily over the fence to steal apples. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>)
<p/>dumped her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) cucumbers onto the ground, pulled up a great tuft of nettles, crept over to
<p/>the fence and hid behind it.

<p/>Sima Simakov peeped through the hole again, but this time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not see the old
<p/>woman. Worried, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped up, caught hold of the top of the fence and began to pull
<p/>himself up cautiously.

<p/>At that moment the old woman leaped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ambush with a triumphant whoop
<p/>and lashed Sima across the hands with the nettles.

<p/>Wildly waving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, Sima dashed back to the gate, through which the other
<p/>boys, now finished with their task, were running out.

<p/>Again, the yard was deserted but for the little boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) picked up a chip of wood, put
<p/>it on the edge of the woodstack, and then dragged over a piece of birchbark. Grandma
<p/>found him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thus occupied when she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) came back from the vegetable garden. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) stared
<p/>with bulging eyes at the neatly stacked logs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who's been at work here while I was away?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>) asked.

<p/>The youngster added his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) birchbark to the stack and said importantly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you see, Grandma? It's me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The youngster</b></font>)</div><p/>The milkwoman came into the yard and the two old women began to talk excitedly
<p/>about the strange happenings with the water and wood. They tried to pump the
<p/>youngster but they learned very little from him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) told them that some people had
<p/>dashed into the yard, stuck sweet strawberries into his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) mouth, had given him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) a feather
<p/>and even promised to catch him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) a hare with two ears and four legs. Then they had
<p/>stacked the firewood and run away.

<p/>Annie came into the yard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Annie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandma</b></font>)</div>said Grandma, <div class="bookquote">``did you see who came into our yard just now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Grandma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I was looking for the goat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>Annie replied sourly. <div class="bookquote">``Been running around all
<p/>morning looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``They stole her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandma</b></font>)</div>Grandma wailed, turning to the milk-woman. <div class="bookquote">``What a goat she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandma</b></font>)
<p/>was! Not a goat but a regular dove. A dove!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some dove!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>snorted Annie, moving away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) grandma. <div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) starts
<p/>tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) horns you can't jump out of the way fast enough! Doves don't have horns.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, Ann! Keep quiet, you silly good-for-nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grandma</b></font>)</div>cried Grandma.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm not saying the goat wasn't a bit high-spirited. I wanted to sell the darling. And my
<p/>dove has flown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>At that moment the gate flew open with a screech. Sweeping the ground with its
<p/>horns, the goat galloped in and headed straight for the milkwoman. That good woman
<p/>snatched up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heavy milk can and leaped onto the porch with a shriek and the goat
<p/>ran into the wall of the house and came to a stop.

<p/>Everybody noticed, then, that a board had been fastened to the animal's horns. On it
<p/>was written:

<p/>I am a goat -- beware!

<p/>A goat of note -- take care!

<p/>Who Annie would beat

<p/>Vengeance I'll wreak!

<p/>Meanwhile, at the corner beyond the fence, the boys, feeling very pleased with
<p/>themselves, were laughing fit to split their sides.




<p/>Sima Siniakov drove a stick into the ground and went galumphing round it in a wild
<p/>dance, chanting proudly:

<p/>We are not a gang of roughs
<p/>Nor a rabble band.

<p/>We are disciplined and tough
<p/>And our pranks are planned.

<p/>Pioneers all are we!

<p/>Pioneers are we!

<p/>Then the boys darted off noiselessly like a flock of martins.

<p/>There was still plenty of work to do, but the chief thing now as to draw up an
<p/>ultimatum and to send it to Misha Kvakin.

<p/>Nobody knew how to draw up an ultimatum, so Timur asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) uncle explained that each country had its own way of drawing up ultimatums
<p/>but that courtesy obliged you to wind them up with the following words:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please accept, Mr. Minister, the assurance of my highest esteem.''

 (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div><p/>After this the ultimatum should be tendered to the head of the hostile country by an
<p/>accredited ambassador.

<p/>But this did not appeal to Timur or to any of the others. First of all, they had no
<p/>intention of conveying any kind of esteem to that hoodlum Kvakin; secondly, they had
<p/>neither a permanent ambassador nor even an envoy accredited to Kvakin's gang.

<p/>After discussing the point they decided to send a simpler ultimatum, like the one the
<p/>Zaporozhye Cossacks sent the Turkish sultan. They had all seen the picture of the
<p/>Cossacks writing their ultimatum and they had read about how the brave fellows
<p/>fought the Turks, the Tatars and the Poles.



<p/>Behind the grey gate with the black-bordered red star in the shady garden of the
<p/>house opposite the house where Olga and Jenny were living, a fair-haired little girl
<p/>was making her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way down the gravel walk. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, a young and pretty woman
<p/>but tired and sad-looking, was sitting in a rocking chair near the window; on the sill
<p/>stood a huge bouquet of wild flowers.

<p/>Before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay a pile of open telegrams and letters -- from relatives and friends,
<p/>acquaintances and strangers.

<p/>The letters and telegrams were full of warm sympathy. They seemed to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
<p/>from a distance, like a forest echo, which calls nowhere and promises nothing, yet
<p/>comforts the traveller with the knowledge that there are people close by and that he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) is
<p/>not alone in the dark woods.

<p/>The fair-haired little girl stopped by the fence, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doll upside down so that
<p/>its wooden arms and hempen braids trailed over the ground. A painted rabbit cut out
<p/>in ply-board was dangling from the top of the fence. The expression on its face was
<p/>droll and rather sad. It was jerking one of its paws strumming a little balalaika.

<p/>Thrilled by this miraculous occurrence, which naturally seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strange and
<p/>wonderful beyond compare, the little girl dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doll and ran up to the fence.
<p/>The rabbit, apparently eager to please, dropped right into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands! Jenny's smiling
<p/>face popped up from behind the fence.




<p/>The little girl looked up at Jenny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you playing with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. Would you like me to jump down?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's some nettles here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>the little girl warned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) after thinking it over. <div class="bookquote">``I stung
<p/>my hand yesterday.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>said Jenny, jumping down. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of it. Show me the
<p/>nettle that stung your hand yesterday. This one? Well, just watch: I'll pull it up, and
<p/>throw it down, and stamp on it and spit on it. All right? Now let's play. You have the
<p/>hare and I'll have the doll.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>From the porch Olga had noticed that Jenny was hanging about near their
<p/>neighbour's fence, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) did not want to interfere with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sister. There had been
<p/>enough tears for one morning. But when Jenny climbed over the fence into the
<p/>neighbour's garden Olga began to worry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) left the house, crossed over to the gate
<p/>and opened it.

<p/>Jenny and the little girl were now standing at the window beside the woman, who
<p/>was smiling as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) daughter showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) how the funny, sad-looking rabbit played the
<p/>balalaika.

<p/>Noting Jenny's perturbed expression when her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sister entered the garden, the woman
<p/>guessed that Olga was displeased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Please don't be angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) said quietly to Olga. <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'s only playing with
<p/>my little girl. This is a sad time for us....''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The woman fell silent. <div class="bookquote">``I've been crying my
<p/>eyes out, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>-- the woman pointed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tiny daughter and added almost in a
<p/>whisper -- <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't even know that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father was killed at the frontier not long
<p/>ago.''

 (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><p/>It was now Olga's turn to feel abashed, while Jenny watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) from some way off
<p/>with an expression of bitter reproach.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And I'm all alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman continued. <div class="bookquote">``My mother lives far, far away in the
<p/>taiga. My brothers are in the Army and I have no sisters.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The young woman put a hand on Jenny's shoulder and pointed to the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was it you who put this bunch of flowers on my porch last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>replied Jenny without stopping to think. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't me. But I expect it was one
<p/>of our. ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One of our what?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga gave Jenny a puzzled look.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny was frightened. <div class="bookquote">``It wasn't me. I don't know anything about it.
<p/>Look, somebody's coming.''

 (<font color='red'><b>officers</b></font>)</div><p/>Two air-force officers were climbing out of a car that had stopped in front of the
<p/>house. They opened the gate and came striding up the garden path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``They've come to see me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman said. <div class="bookquote">``I know what it is: they're going to ask
<p/>me again if it wouldn't be good for me to have a change, if I wouldn't like to go to the
<p/>Crimea or to the Caucasus, to a sanatorium or to a holiday resort. ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div><p/>The men touched their caps. The senior officer, a captain, must have caught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last
<p/>words, for he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, neither to the Crimea, nor to the Caucasus, nor to a sanatorium, nor to a
<p/>holiday resort. You wanted to see your mother, didn't you? Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s coming to pay
<p/>you a visit. Leaving today from Irkutsk. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was brought to Irkutsk by a special
<p/>plane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman exclaimed in a happy and dazed voice. <div class="bookquote">``You?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the captain replied. <div class="bookquote">``Our comrades and yours.''




 (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The little girl came running up and looked boldly at the visitors; it was obvious that
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was used to the blue uniform.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mummy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``make me a swing and I'll go flying to and fro, to and fro. Far,
<p/>far away, like Daddy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother cried. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) picked up the little girl and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tight.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, never fly away as far ... as your daddy.''



 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>On a daisy-covered green off Maly Ovrazhny Lane, behind the chapel whose
<p/>peeling murals depicted stern, bearded old men and clean-shaven angels, and
<p/>somewhat to the right of the picture of Judgement Day with its cauldrons, boiling oil
<p/>and darting devils, Kvakin's gang was playing cards.

<p/>They had no money, and so they played for <div class="bookquote">``back-breakers'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>, <div class="bookquote">``flicks''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and ``revive-
<p/>the-stiff'. The loser's eyes were bound, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) was forced to lie on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) back on the grass,
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) was given a <div class="bookquote">``candle'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, that is, a long stick. With this stick he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) was supposed to
<p/>repel his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) kind brethren, who out of pity for the dead man would do everything they
<p/>could to revive him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) by energetically lashing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) bare shins, calves and heels with
<p/>nettle.

<p/>The game was at its height when the shrill call of a bugle came from the other side
<p/>of the fence.

<p/>Timur's envoys stood there.

<p/>Nick Kolokolchikov, the staff trumpeter, gripped a shiny brass bugle in one hand,
<p/>while the barefoot Geika, his (<font color='blue'><b>Kolokolchikov</b></font>) face stern, held a big envelope made of wrapping paper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What kind of circus act is this?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the boy they called Figure, leaning over the
<p/>fence. <div class="bookquote">``Misha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) yelled over his (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Drop the game, there's a sort of
<p/>delegation here to see you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Here I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>said Kvakin, hoisting himself up on the fence. <div class="bookquote">``Hiya there, Geika!
<p/>Who's that shrimp you've got with you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take this envelope.''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika handed over the ultimatum. <div class="bookquote">``You have twenty-four
<p/>hours to think it over. I shall come back for your answer at the same time tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div><p/>Touched on the raw at being called a shrimp, Nick Kolokolchikov raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Kolokolchikov</b></font>) bugle
<p/>and, blowing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Kolokolchikov</b></font>) cheeks, sounded a furious retreat. The two envoys then departed
<p/>in a dignified silence under the inquisitive stares of the boys strung along the fence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this, anyway?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>said Kvakin, fingering the envelope and looking at the
<p/>gaping boys. <div class="bookquote">``Here we were, minding our own business, and then bugles, threats! No,
<p/>fellas, I can't make head or tail of it!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) tore open the envelope and, perched as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) was on the fence, began to read:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Mikhail Kvakin, Chief of the Gang for the Mop-ping-up of Other People's
<p/>Gardens.' That's me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) explained in a loud voice. <div class="bookquote">``Full title and all the trimmings.
<p/>`And his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>),' ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) continued, '' `inglorious assistant Peter Pyatakov, otherwise known
<p/>simply as Figure.' That's you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) explained with satisfaction to Figure. <div class="bookquote">``Sounds good,
<p/>`inglorious'! Too high-sounding though, if you ask me; they could have called the fool
<p/>something simpler. `And likewise to all the members of their infamous band -- an ul-ti-
<p/>ma-tum.' What that is I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>announced Kvakin sarcastically. <div class="bookquote">``Most likely a
<p/>swearword of some sort.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's an international word. Means they're going to lash us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>explained the boy, who
<p/>was standing next to Figure, a close-cropped lad called Alex.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why don't they say so!''  (<font color='red'><b>a lad</b></font>)</div>said Kvakin. <div class="bookquote">``Now we come to Article One:




<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>inhabitants</b></font>)</div>`In consideration of the fact that you make night raids on the gardens of peaceful
<p/>inhabitants, not sparing houses bearing our sign -- a red star -- or even those bearing the
<p/>star with the black border of mourning, we order you, you cowardly scoundrels...

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you beat it? Just listen to how they swear -- the dogs!''  (<font color='red'><b>scoundrels</b></font>)</div>continued Kvakin,
<p/>forcing a smile. <div class="bookquote">``And look at all the fancy words and commas! Boy!

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>`We order you, Mikhail Kvakin, and that altogether inglorious individual, Figure,
<p/>to appear at the place indicated by our messengers at a time not later than tomorrow
<p/>morning, bringing with you a list of all the members of your infamous band.'

<p/>'' `In the event of a refusal, we shall consider ourselves at liberty to take any further
<p/>action we may think fit.' ''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do they mean -- `at liberty'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin pondered. <div class="bookquote">``We never locked them up
<p/>anywhere, did we?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It's another of those international words. Means they're going to lash us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alex</b></font>)</div>the close-
<p/>cropped Alex explained again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then why don't they say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin said with annoyance. <div class="bookquote">``Too bad Geika's gone;
<p/>looks like he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) hasn't cried for a long time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) won't cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alex</b></font>)</div>Alex said. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Alex</b></font>) brother's a sailor.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Alex</b></font>) father was a sailor too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alex</b></font>) won't cry.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What's it to you, anyway?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My uncle's a sailor too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Cut it out, will you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin flared up. <div class="bookquote">``Father, brother, uncle, what's it all mean,
<p/>anyway! Better let your hair grow, Alex -- looks like you've got sunstroke. And what
<p/>are you mumbling about?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alex</b></font>) turned on Figure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We've got to catch those messengers tomorrow and give that Timur and his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) lot a
<p/>licking,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Figure sullenly, nettled by the ultimatum.

<p/>They left it at that.

<p/>Withdrawing to the shade of the chapel, the chief and his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) assistant stopped by a
<p/>painting depicting agile and muscular devils dragging howling and resisting sinners
<p/>towards the everlasting furnace. Kvakin asked Figure:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, was that you in the garden where that girl lives, the one whose father
<p/>was killed?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right. What about it?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, it's like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin muttered glumly, poking his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) finger at the mural. <div class="bookquote">``I
<p/>don't give a damn for Timur's signs and I can make mincemeat of him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) any day. ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>agreed Figure. <div class="bookquote">``So what're you poking your finger at the devils for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>replied Kvakin with a crooked grin, <div class="bookquote">``even though you're a pal of mine,
<p/>Figure, you're not human, you're more like this dirty fat old beast of a devil.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div><p/>In the morning three of the milkwoman's regular customers were not at home when
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) called to deliver the milk. It was too late for her (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) to go to the market, so, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)
<p/>milk can onto her (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) shoulder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) set out on a round of the houses.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) trudged from door to door without success until she (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) finally stopped to rest near
<p/>Timur's house.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) heard a deep, pleasant voice singing in the yard. That meant the owners were in
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) might have some luck there.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) came through the gate the old woman sang out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Milk, anyone want milk here?''




 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two measures!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied a bass voice.

<p/>Lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) can to the ground, the milkwoman turned around and saw a grizzled
<p/>and tattered old man come limping out from behind the bushes brandishing a sabre.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was saying, did you want any milk, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the nrilk-woman asked, backing away in
<p/>alarm. <div class="bookquote">``Goodness me, how rough you look! What do you use that sabre for -- to cut
<p/>the grass?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two measures. You'll find a jug on the table,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man answered shortly and
<p/>stuck the point of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sabre into the ground.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to buy a scythe, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the milkwoman continued, hastily pouring the
<p/>milk into the jug and glancing warily at the old man, <div class="bookquote">``and throw that sabre away. You
<p/>might scare a simple body to death with a sabre like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How much?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man asked, thrusting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand into the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) baggy
<p/>trousers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The usual price,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the milkwoman. <div class="bookquote">``Two-eighty a litre. I don't overcharge.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man rummaged about in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket and produced a large, battered revolver.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oi, you can pay later,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>the milkwoman babbled, snatching up her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can and making
<p/>off. <div class="bookquote">``Don't trouble yourself, dearie!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, almost running now and glancing
<p/>back over her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``I can wait for the money.''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hurried through the gate, slammed it shut and shouted out angrily from the lane:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You ought to be put away, you old devil, and not left to run about loose. Yes, yes!
<p/>Under lock and key is where you belong!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders, stuffed the three-ruble note which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been
<p/>holding ready back into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket and quickly hid the revolver behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, for
<p/>Doctor Kolokolchikov, the elderly gentleman, was coming into the garden.

<p/>The doctor was stalking down the gravel walk with a serious and concentrated
<p/>mien, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stick. When he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) caught sight of the eccentric old man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coughed,
<p/>adjusted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spectacles and inquired:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me where I can find the owner of this house, my good man?''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I live in this house,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man replied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In that case,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the elderly gentleman, tipping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) straw hat, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you can
<p/>tell me whether a certain young lad, one Timur Garayev, is a relative of yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Garayev</b></font>) is. That `certain young lad' happens to be my nephew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It pains me very much indeed to tell you this,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>began the elderly gentleman,
<p/>clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) throat and looking askance at the sabre which was still sticking out of the
<p/>ground where its owner had left it, <div class="bookquote">``but yesterday morning your nephew attempted to
<p/>rob our house.''

 (<font color='red'><b>owner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What? My Timur tried to rob your house?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, just imagine!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>continued the elderly gentleman, trying to see what it was the
<p/>old man was hiding behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back and beginning to get worked up. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to steal
<p/>my flannel blanket while I was asleep.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who? Timur? Stole your flannel blanket?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man was quite at a loss. The
<p/>hand holding the revolver involuntarily fell to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side.

<p/>The elderly gentleman was now visibly alarmed. Backing toward the gate with as
<p/>much dignity as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could muster, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) began to speak soothingly:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I wouldn't swear to it, but still the facts -- the facts! My dear sir! I beg
<p/>you -- please do not come any closer. Naturally -- I have no idea why -- but your
<p/>appearance, your strange behaviour. ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>declared the old man, advancing on the doctor. <div class="bookquote">``There must be some
<p/>misunderstanding. ''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>cried the elderly gentleman, staring hypnotised at the revolver and
<p/>continuing to retreat. <div class="bookquote">``This conversation of ours is taking a most undesirable and, I
<p/>might say, considering our age, a most undignified course.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stepped quickly through the gate and hurried away, repeating:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, a most undesirable course -- most undignified!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man reached the gate just as Olga, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) way to have a swim in the river,
<p/>came level with the agitated gentleman.

<p/>Suddenly the old man began waving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms and calling to Olga to stop. At this the
<p/>elderly gentleman leaped over a ditch with the agility of a goat, seized Olga's hand
<p/>and, in a twinkling, the two disappeared around the corner.

<p/>The old man burst out laughing. Obviously elated and thoroughly pleased with
<p/>himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went stumping off on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wooden leg singing:

<p/>But you'll never understand

<p/>Flying fast above the land

<p/>How long and slow the waiting for your plane!

<p/>Ah!

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unfastened the strap at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knee, flung the wooden leg into the grass and,
<p/>tearing off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wig and beard, ran into the house.

<p/>Ten minutes later the young and cheerful engineer George Garayev ran down the
<p/>steps, wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Garayev</b></font>) motorcycle out of the barn, called the dog Rita and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) to guard
<p/>the house, pressed the starter, swung into the saddle and sped off to the river in search
<p/>of the frightened Olga.

<p/>At 1 1 a.m. Geika and Nick set out for the reply to the ultimatum.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Walk straight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika growled at Nick. <div class="bookquote">``You ought to walk with a light and firm
<p/>step. But you go hopping along like a chicken trying to catch a worm. Your get-up's
<p/>fine -- pants, shirt and everything -- but you still look like nothing on earth. Don't go
<p/>and take offence -- I'm talking sense to you. Now why do you have to lick your lips as
<p/>you go along? Stick your tongue back in your mouth and keep it where it belongs... .
<p/>And what are you doing here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika asked Sima Simakov, who had just popped up
<p/>in their path.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Timur sent me to act as liaison,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sima Simakov/Simakov/Sima</b></font>)</div>Simakov rattled off. <div class="bookquote">``It's okay even if you don't
<p/>know what it's all about. Y ou've got your assignment and I've got mine. Nick, let me
<p/>blow your bugle -- just once. Boy, aren't you looking important today! Geika, you nut!
<p/>You might have put a pair of boots or shoes on when you're on a mission! Ever see a
<p/>barefoot ambassador? Well, so long -- you go that way and I go this way. Be seeing
<p/>you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a rattle-pate!''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika shook his (<font color='blue'><b>ambassador</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Shoots of a hundred words where four
<p/>would do. Sound your bugle, Herald, here's the fence.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring up Mikhail Kvakin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika told the boy whose head appeared above the
<p/>fence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the right, please. You'll find the gate open to welcome you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin called
<p/>from the other side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's not go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div>Nick whispered to Geika, tugging at his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``They'll beat us up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You mean all of them against us two?''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika said contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">``Blow your
<p/>bugle, Nick -- louder! We go wherever we choose!''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>They walked through the rusty iron gate and found themselves face to face with a
<p/>group of boys. In front stood Figure and Kvakin.




<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's have the answer to our letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika demanded firmly.

<p/>Kvakin was smiling, Figure scowling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's talk this over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin offered. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down a while, what's the hurry?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give us the answer to the letter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika insisted coldly. <div class="bookquote">``We can talk afterwards.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was hard to tell whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) was play-acting, this upright, sturdy chap in the
<p/>sailor's jersey, at whose side stood the puny, now pallid bugler. Or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>bugler</b></font>) was
<p/>really demanding an answer as he (<font color='blue'><b>bugler</b></font>) stood there, barefoot and broad-shouldered, his (<font color='blue'><b>bugler</b></font>) grey
<p/>eyes mere slits, confident that justice and power were on his (<font color='blue'><b>bugler</b></font>) side.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here, take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>said Kvakin, handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) a note.

<p/>Geika unfolded the sheet of paper. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) saw was a crude drawing of a thumb to
<p/>a nose captioned with a dirty word.

<p/>Geika calmly tore the sheet in two; not a muscle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) face moved. And at that
<p/>moment the two boys were seized by the arms.

<p/>They did not resist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You deserve a black eye for delivering ultimatums like that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>said Kvakin, coming
<p/>up to Geika. <div class="bookquote">``But we don't want to be too hard on you. We'll lock you up till night
<p/>time in here''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) pointed to the chapel -- <div class="bookquote">``and during the night we'll clean out the
<p/>garden at No.24.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh no, you won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>replied Geika unruffled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh yes, we will!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Figure, hitting Geika in the face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can hit me a hundred times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>said Geika. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) eyes tight and then
<p/>opened them again. <div class="bookquote">``Nick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) grunted encouragingly, <div class="bookquote">``keep your pecker up. I've got a
<p/>feeling there'll be a No. 1 general rallying signal today.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The captives were shoved into the small chapel with its closed iron shutters. Both
<p/>doors were then locked, bolted and barred from the outside.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Figure shouted at the door through cupped palms, <div class="bookquote">``how are things going
<p/>now, your way or ours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>From inside came a hollow, scarcely audible answer:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, you bums, from now on things'll never go your way any more!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Figure spat in disgust.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) brother's a sailor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alex</b></font>)</div>the close-cropped Alex explained morosely. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Alex</b></font>) and my
<p/>uncle serve on the same ship.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So what?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Figure asked menacingly. <div class="bookquote">``Who are you, the captain or what?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You hit him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) couldn't use his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hands. Is that fair now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll sock you one, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div>Figure snarled and swung his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) fist at Alex.

<p/>The two boys rolled over and over on the grass. The others grabbed them by the
<p/>arms and legs and tried to haul them apart.

<p/>Nobody noticed Sima Simakov's face appearing briefly in the thick foliage of a lime
<p/>tree which grew near the fence.

<p/>Sima slipped to the ground and sprinted across the vegetable patches toward the
<p/>river, where Timur and the boys were swimming.



<p/>Olga, her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) head covered with a towel, was lying on the hot sandy beach reading.
<p/>Jenny was having a bathe. Suddenly somebody came up from behind and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) a
<p/>hug.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) turned round.




<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello,''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>said a tall, dark-eyed girl. <div class="bookquote">``Timur sent me, my name's Tanya, and I'm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)
<p/>company too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)'s sorry you got into trouble with your sister because of him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>). Your
<p/>sister must be awfully bad-tempered, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) not to feel sorry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>muttered Jenny, reddening. <div class="bookquote">``Olga isn't bad-tempered at
<p/>all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'s a bit tough, that's all.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) made a little gesture of exasperation and added on
<p/>a note of despair: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, sister! Just you wait till Dad comes home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>They clambered out onto the steep bank a little bit to the left of the beach. Here they
<p/>ran into Annie.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, recognise me?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) asked Jenny, speaking, as always, very quickly through
<p/>clenched teeth. <div class="bookquote">``You do? I recognised you right away. There's Timur!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) pointed to
<p/>the opposite bank, which was teeming with boys. <div class="bookquote">``I know who found the goat for me,
<p/>and who stacked the firewood, and who gave my brother the strawberries. And I know
<p/>you too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) said, turning to Tanya. <div class="bookquote">``I once saw you sitting in your vegetable garden
<p/>crying. You oughtn't to cry. Doesn't do any good. Hey, stand still, you devil, or I'll
<p/>throw you into the water!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) yelled at the goat, which was tied to a clump of bushes.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) pulled off her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>) dress. <div class="bookquote">``Come on, girls, let's jump in!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny and Tanya exchanged glances. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) was somehow very comical, this
<p/>sunburned girl who looked like a Gypsy!

<p/>Holding hands, they went up to the edge of the steep bank overlooking the clear,
<p/>rippling, blue water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, shall we jump?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, let's!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And all together they plunged into the water.

<p/>No sooner had they surfaced than somebody else plopped in by their side.

<p/>It was Sima Simakov who had taken a running dive from the bank in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sandals,
<p/>shorts and shirt.

<p/>Tossing back his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wet hair and spluttering and snorting, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) swam off with long
<p/>strokes toward the opposite bank.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trouble, Jenny, big trouble!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) shouted over his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Geika and Nick've
<p/>been locked up!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>Olga strolled up the hill reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) book. Where the steep path cut across the road
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) came upon George standing by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) motorcycle. They greeted each other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was riding along when I saw you coming. So I thought I'd wait and give you a lift
<p/>if you were going the same way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not true!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga retorted. <div class="bookquote">``You were waiting for me on purpose.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right, I was,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>said George. <div class="bookquote">``Have it your way if you like. I must apologise for
<p/>scaring you this morning. I was the lame old fellow at the gate, you see. I was dressed
<p/>for rehearsal. Climb on and I'll take you home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>Olga shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) head.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) placed a bouquet of flowers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) book.

<p/>It was a nice bouquet. Olga blushed in confusion -- and threw it to the ground.

<p/>George had not expected that.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said with chagrin. <div class="bookquote">``You play and sing well, and you have nice
<p/>straightforward eyes. I haven't offended you in any way. I don't think even people of
<p/>the most reinforced concrete professions should act like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't give me flowers!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga said guiltily, frightened by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) had
<p/>done. <div class="bookquote">``You -- you can give me a lift without offering me flowers.''




 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) seat on the leather cushion and the motorcycle sped off.

<p/>When the bike came to a fork in the road it ignored the road to the estate and tore
<p/>down the one leading out into the open country.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You've taken the wrong road,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga shouted. <div class="bookquote">``We should have gone to the right!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``This is a better road,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>George replied. <div class="bookquote">``It's more fun this way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Another turn, and they roared through a rustling, shady stand of trees. A dog left its
<p/>herd to bark at them and chase the bike. But the motorcycle was already far away.

<p/>Then a lorry came whining down the road like a heavy artillery shell in trajectory.
<p/>When George and Olga broke out from the clouds of dust which it had raised, they
<p/>came into sight of the belching smokestacks, and glass and steel buildings of what
<p/>looked like some strange city at the foot of a hill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's our plant!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>George shouted. <div class="bookquote">``Three years ago I used to come here to pick
<p/>mushrooms and wild strawberries!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Almost without slackening speed, the motorcycle executed a U turn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Straight ahead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga cried wamingly. <div class="bookquote">``Head straight for home!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Suddenly the motor died down and they came to a stop.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>George said, jumping to the ground. <div class="bookquote">``A minor breakdown.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) rolled the machine over to a birch tree by the side of the road, took out a
<p/>monkey wrench and began to tinker with the motor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What part are you playing in your opera?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga asked, seating herself on the grass.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why is your get-up so stem and frightening?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got the part of an old soldier,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>replied George, busy with the motor. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s an
<p/>ex-partisan and a bit off his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lives near the border and is obsessed by the idea
<p/>that our enemies might outwit us. But the soldiers are a gay young lot and spend their
<p/>off-duty A hours playing volleyball. There are all sorts of girls too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>George twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) features into a frown and began to sing in a low voice:

<p/>Again the moon is dimmed behind the clouds.

<p/>Three nights I've kept my weary watch -- but shrouds
<p/>Of misty silence hide the slinking foe.

<p/>Even now he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) is at hand!

<p/>But I am old and weak, so sleep not thou,

<p/>Sleep not, my motherland!

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) switched to another key and chanted in imitation of the chorus:

<p/>Be still, old man -- be still!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do they mean by `be still'?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga asked, wiping the dust from her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) lips with a
<p/>handkerchief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It means,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>explained George, continuing to work away with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) monkey wrench,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``it means sleep in peace, you old fool! Officers and men are at their posts... . Olga,
<p/>did your sister tell you about our talk?''

 (<font color='red'><b>monkey</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) did, and I scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You shouldn't have. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'s a very amusing child. I said `Oh', and she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) said, `Boo'!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That amusing child can make life pretty difficult,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga said. <div class="bookquote">``A boy by the name
<p/>of Timur has been hanging around her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)'s in with that hoodlum Kvakin. I simply
<p/>can't seem to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) away from our house.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Timur? Hm-hm,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>George coughed in embarrassment. <div class="bookquote">``Mean to say he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s in that
<p/>gang? I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s one of those ... not likely ... oh well! Don't you worry. I'll
<p/>see he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) leaves your house alone. Olya, why don't you study music? What's an engineer,
<p/>anyway? I'm an engineer myself and look at me!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aren't you a good engineer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>replied George, moving closer to Olga and starting to tinker with
<p/>the hub of the front wheel. <div class="bookquote">``I'm not at all a bad engineer, but you play and sing so
<p/>well.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>murmured Olga. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) moved away in confusion. <div class="bookquote">``I don't know
<p/>what sort of engineer you are, but you certainly go about repairing your machine in a
<p/>very odd way.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>Olga gestured in imitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) aimless tapping at the plugs and the outside of the
<p/>engine with his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) monkey wrench.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing odd about it at all. Everything's being done in the proper way.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) jumped
<p/>to his (<font color='blue'><b>engineer</b></font>) feet and gave the frame a couple of taps with the monkey wrench. <div class="bookquote">``There you
<p/>are, the job's finished. Olga, is your father an Army officer?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's fine. I'm one too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There's no making you out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) shoulders. <div class="bookquote">``First you're an
<p/>engineer, then an actor and now an Army officer. Perhaps you're a flyer as well?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>laughed George. <div class="bookquote">``Flyers dump bombs onto people's heads from above, but
<p/>we strike through iron and through reinforced concrete -- straight to the heart.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Again the rye fields, woods and river whirled past. Soon they came to Olga's house.

<p/>At the sound of the motorcycle Jenny came skipping out onto the porch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
<p/>blushed when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) saw George, but after he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had driven off she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) went up to Olga,
<p/>hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) and said enviously:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ooh, how lucky you are today, Olga!''



 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>At the chapel, the boys had gone off after arranging to meet again later near the
<p/>garden of No. 24.

<p/>Only Figure remained behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was perplexed and angered by the silence inside
<p/>the chapel. The captives neither yelled, nor pounded on the door, nor responded to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
<p/>taunts and questions.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) then tried a ruse. Opening the outer door, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) entered the stone -walled vestibule
<p/>and held his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breath.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was standing there with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ear glued to the keyhole, the outer door
<p/>suddenly closed with a bang, as though someone had hit it with a log.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hey, who's there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) demanded angrily, springing to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Hey, cut out the
<p/>tricks or I'll sock you one!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No one replied. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heard strange voices outside. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heard the shutters
<p/>creaking. Someone began to talk to the captives through the bars of the window.

<p/>Then the boys inside the chapel burst out laughing. The sound of that laughter made
<p/>Figure feel uneasy.

<p/>At last the outside door was thrown open. Timur, Simakov and Ladygin stood in the
<p/>doorway.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Open the second door!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur ordered without stirring from his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) place. <div class="bookquote">``Open it
<p/>yourself, if you don't want things happening to you!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Figure reluctantly drew the bolt. Nick and Geika came out of the chapel.




<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now take their place!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur ordered. <div class="bookquote">``Get in, you swine, quick now!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) shouted,
<p/>clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) fists. <div class="bookquote">``I've no time to waste talking to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Both doors were slammed to on Figure. A heavy bolt was shot through the iron
<p/>loops and a padlock fixed to it.

<p/>Then Timur took a sheet of paper and scribbled on it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) blue pencil:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kvakin, no need for a sentry. I've locked them up and am taking the key. I'll come
<p/>straight to the meeting place this evening.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>They ran off. Five minutes later Kvakin came through the gate.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) read the note, fingered the lock, grinned, and retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) steps to the gate while
<p/>Figure pounded frantically at the iron door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) fists and heels.

<p/>At the gate Kvakin turned around and muttered indifferently:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pound away, Geika! You'll have plenty of time to get fed up with it before
<p/>evening!''



 (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Just before sundown, Timur and Simakov made their way to the market square. At
<p/>the edge of a straggling row of stalls dealing in soft drinks, vegetables, tobacco,
<p/>groceries and ice cream, stood a rickety empty booth where cobblers worked on
<p/>market days.

<p/>Timur and Simakov spent a few minutes in that booth.

<p/>At dusk the helm in the loft went into action. One after another the wires tightened,
<p/>conveying the right signals to the right places.

<p/>Reinforcements poured in. Quite a large number of boys had already gathered --
<p/>about two or three dozen. And more kept creeping noiselessly through gaps in the
<p/>fences.

<p/>Tanya and Annie were sent away. Jenny stayed at home too. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) assignment was to
<p/>keep Olga from going out into the garden.

<p/>Timur stood by the helm.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Repeat the signal over the sixth line,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sima Simakov/Simakov/Sima</b></font>)</div>Simakov requested anxiously, sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)
<p/>head through the window. <div class="bookquote">``We don't seem to be getting any reaction on it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/>Two boys were busy making a kind of placard out of a piece of plywood. Ladygin's
<p/>group arrived.

<p/>At last the scouts came in with reports. Kvakin's gang was assembled on the
<p/>common outside the garden of No. 24.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Time to start,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>said Timur. <div class="bookquote">``Get ready, boys!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) released the wheel and pulled a rope. Slowly the company's flag rose and rippled
<p/>over the old barn in the uneven light of the moon that was shuttling in and out of the
<p/>clouds. This was the signal for battle.



<p/>A file of a dozen boys crept along the fence of No. 24. Halting in the shade, Kvakin
<p/>said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody's here but Figure.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>)'s smart,''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone remarked. <div class="bookquote">``I'll bet he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>)'s in the garden already. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) always
<p/>barges in first.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Kvakin removed two previously loosened boards from the fence and climbed
<p/>through. The others followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>). Alex remained in the street to keep watch.

<p/>Five heads peeped out from the nettle and weed filled ditch on the other side of the
<p/>road. Four of them disappeared again. The fifth -- Nick Kolokolchikov's -- did not




<p/>follow immediately, but a hand reached up and slapped it on the crown and this head,
<p/>too, vanished from sight.

<p/>Alex, the sentry, looked around. All was quiet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alex</b></font>) stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Alex</b></font>) head through the
<p/>hole in the fence to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alex</b></font>) could hear what was going on inside the garden.

<p/>Three boys crept out of the ditch. The next moment the sentry felt strong hands
<p/>gripping his (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) arms and legs, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) could cry out he (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) was yanked back from the
<p/>fence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Geika!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) muttered, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">``Where'd you come from?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>hissed Geika, <div class="bookquote">``better hold your tongue! Or I'll forget that you stood
<p/>up for me.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Okay,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>agreed Alex. <div class="bookquote">``I'll shut up.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Whereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) immediately and unexpectedly gave a shrill whistle.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) mouth was clapped shut at once by Geika's broad palm. Hands grabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) and
<p/>dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) away.

<p/>The boys in the garden heard the whistle. Kvakin spun around. The whistle was not
<p/>repeated. Kvakin peered into the darkness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) saw the bushes in the corner
<p/>of the garden moving.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Figure!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) called in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">``That you hiding there, you fool?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Kvakin! There's a light!''  (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div>somebody shouted suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Look out, here they come!''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>In the bushes behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) at least a dozen electric torches were switched on. They
<p/>advanced quickly on the raiders, confusing and blinding them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fight 'em, don't run!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>cried Kvakin, reaching into his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) pocket for an apple and
<p/>hurling it at the lights. <div class="bookquote">``Grab the torches and twist their arms off! It's Timur!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Timur is here and so am I!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sima Siniakov/Sima/Siniakov</b></font>)</div>Siniakov yelled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) leapt out from behind a bush.

<p/>Another dozen or so boys bore down on them from the rear and flanks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oho!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>yelled Kvakin. <div class="bookquote">``They've got a regular army here! Run for the fence, fellas!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The ambushed band made a panic-stricken rush for the fence. Jostling and bumping
<p/>into one another, the boys tumbled out into the road and fell straight into the arms of
<p/>Ladygin and Geika.

<p/>The moon had quite disappeared behind a cloud. Only voices were to be heard in
<p/>the darkness:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lemme go!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Hands off! Hey!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Quiet, everybody!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur's voice rang out. <div class="bookquote">``Don't knock the prisoners about!
<p/>Where's Geika?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm here!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take them away!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Suppose they won't go?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Frog-march 'em!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Lemme go, you fdthy rats!''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>someone whined.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur demanded furiously. <div class="bookquote">``Aha, you can dish it out but you can't
<p/>take it! Geika, give the order and get a move on!''

 (<font color='red'><b>The prisoners</b></font>)</div><p/>The prisoners were led to the empty booth on the fringe of the market square and
<p/>pushed inside one after another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring Kvakin over here to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur ordered.

<p/>Kvakin was led up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>asked Timur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``All ready.''




 (<font color='red'><b>The prisoner</b></font>)</div><p/>The last prisoner was shoved into the booth and the door was bolted and locked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run along,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur told Kvakin. <div class="bookquote">``You're just a joke. Nobody's afraid of you and
<p/>nobody needs you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Kvakin stood looking down, expecting a beating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Run along,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Timur repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Take this key and let your friend Figure out of the
<p/>chapel.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div><p/>Kvakin did not move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let the fellas out or lemme in with them,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) growled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>said Timur, <div class="bookquote">``that's over and done with. You're finished with them and they're
<p/>finished with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>A cacophony of whistles and catcalls followed Kvakin as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) slowly walked off,
<p/>hunching his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) shoulders. Ten paces away he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) stopped and straightened up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll beat the life out of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) shouted savagely at Timur. <div class="bookquote">``I'll smash you single-
<p/>handed. To a pulp!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>After which he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) plunged into the darkness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ladygin, you and your five can go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>said Timur. <div class="bookquote">``What's your next assignment?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. 22, Bolshaya Vasilkovskaya -- stack the logs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fine. Get to work!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A whistle blew at the station nearby. A suburban train had pulled in and the
<p/>passengers would soon be coming from the station. Timur began to hurry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Simakov, you and your five -- what's yours?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No. 38, Malaya Petrakovskaya.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) added with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``Same as usual: buckets,
<p/>barrel and water. S'long!''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fine, get to work! Well, and now ... people are coming this way. The rest can go
<p/>home. Quick now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>As the new arrivals began to trickle into the square an infernal clatter broke out.
<p/>They stopped in alarm. Another outburst of banging and yelling followed. Lights went
<p/>on in the windows of neighbouring houses. Somebody switched on the light over the
<p/>market stalls, and the crowd saw the following notice hanging on the booth:

<p/>PASSERS-BY, DON'T BE SORRY FOR THEM!

<p/>Inside are people who sneak into the gardens of peaceful residents at night and

<p/>steal apples and things.

<p/>The key to the padlock is behind this notice. The person who releases the

<p/>prisoners is warned first to make sure he (<font color='blue'><b>THEM</b></font>) has no relatives or friends among them.

<p/>It is late at night and the black-bordered red star on the gate is invisible. But it is
<p/>there.

<p/>Once again, the scene is the garden of the house where the little girl lives.

<p/>Two ropes are let down from a branch of a tree. A boy climbs down the rough
<p/>trunk, fastens a board to the ropes and sits on it to see whether the new swing -- for
<p/>swing it is -- is strong enough.

<p/>The stout branch creaks a bit, the leaves rustle and stir. A bird, disturbed from its
<p/>slumbers, twitters and flaps its wings. It is quite late. Olga has gone to bed long ago.
<p/>Jenny is asleep, and so are the boy's comrades: the jolly Simakov, the taciturn
<p/>Ladygin, funny little Nick. Brave Geika is tossing about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) bed and mumbling in
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) sleep.

<p/>The clock in the watch-tower strikes the quarter hour: <div class="bookquote">``A day's passed -- a deed's
<p/>done! Ding-dong! One, two!''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, it is quite late.

<p/>The boy gets off the swing, searches in the grass and picks up a heavy bouquet of
<p/>wild flowers.

<p/>Jenny had gathered them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tiptoes softly up the steps of the moonlit porch so as not to wake and frighten
<p/>the sleepers, and places the bouquet carefully on the top step. The boy is Timur.

<p/>It was Sunday morning. The Young Communist League had arranged a grand
<p/>carnival and concert in the park to celebrate the anniversary of the victory of the Red
<p/>Army at Lake Hassan in the Far East.

<p/>The girls had run off to the carnival grounds early in the morning. Olga quickly
<p/>ironed her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) blouse and then took stock of the wardrobe. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) shook out Jenny's
<p/>sun-dress a slip of paper fell out of the pocket.

<p/>Olga picked it up and read:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No need to be afraid of anyone at home. Everything's fine and I won't tell. Timur.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>What wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Army</b></font>) tell? What didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) need to be afraid of? What sort of a secret
<p/>was that sly, close child hiding from her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)? No! This must be put an end to. When Dad
<p/>left he (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) had said... . She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) must act quickly and firmly.

<p/>George tapped at the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Olga,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``you've got to help me! A delegation's come round -- they
<p/>want me to sing at the concert. Today's such an occasion -- I couldn't very well refuse.
<p/>I want you to accompany me on your accordion.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes -- but why don't you get a pianist?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga said in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``Why do you want an
<p/>accordion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Olga, I don't want a pianist, I want to sing with you! It'll work out fine. May I jump
<p/>in through the window? Put that iron away and take out your accordion. Here, I've got
<p/>it out myself. All you have to do is press the keys and I'll sing.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga, ruffled. <div class="bookquote">``Must you climb in through the window
<p/>when there is a perfectly good door?''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a noisy crowd in the park. Cars filled with holiday-makers rolled up in a
<p/>continuous stream. Vans drove up laden with sandwiches, buns, soft drinks, sausages,
<p/>sweets and cakes. An array of ice cream vendors spread out over the grounds.

<p/>Phonographs screeched in every imaginable key over the lawns where picnickers
<p/>were settling down to unpack their lunches.

<p/>The bands blared. At the entrance to the open-air theatre the old doorman was
<p/>arguing with a telegraph line repairman who was trying to enter with all his (<font color='blue'><b>repairman</b></font>) tools --
<p/>monkey wrenches, straps, iron spikes and all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, man, you can't go in with those tools. Today's a holiday. You go home first,
<p/>give yourself a wash and brush up and put on some decent clothes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But it's a free performance, isn't it? I don't need a ticket!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Makes no difference. They're singing in there. Only thing you've forgotten to bring
<p/>with you's your telegraph pole. You move along too, citizen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) said to another man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't you hear there's a concert on, singing and music? And you've got a bottle
<p/>sticking out of your pocket!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But look here, old boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the other stuttered. <div class="bookquote">``I've got to -- I'm the tenor!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along with you -- Tenor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doorman</b></font>)</div>retorted the old doorman. He (<font color='blue'><b>doorman</b></font>) pointed to the
<p/>repairman. <div class="bookquote">``This Bass over here isn't making trouble. You'd better keep quiet too.''




 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny, who had been told by the boys that Olga had gone backstage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)
<p/>accordion, fidgeted impatiently in her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) seat.

<p/>At last George and Olga came onto the stage. Jenny was terrified: she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) was afraid the
<p/>audience would laugh at Olga.

<p/>But nobody laughed.

<p/>George and Olga looked so nice, young and gay standing there on the stage that
<p/>Jenny felt like rushing up and hugging them both.

<p/>Olga picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) accordion.

<p/>A deep line furrowed George's forehead. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hunched his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shoulders and lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
<p/>head. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was an old man now, and in a low, sonorous voice he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) began to sing:

<p/>Three nights I've kept my weary watch.

<p/>I peer Into the dismal dark and always seem to hear
<p/>Muffled, suspicious sounds -- my rifle burns
<p/>Uneasy in my hand

<p/>And, as full twen ty years ago, so my heart yearns
<p/>Now to defend my land.

<p/>As in the long nights of that other war
<p/>I keep good watch as I have watched before. .

<p/>And if I'm called upon to help my country's plight
<p/>Against a hireling foe,

<p/>`Then -- old man though 1 be -- I'll stand and fight
<p/>As twenty years ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lovely! Poor brave old fellow! What a beautiful voice,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny murmured to
<p/>herself. <div class="bookquote">``That's the way, Olga! What a pity Dad isn't here to see you play!''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>After the concert George and Olga strolled hand in hand through the park.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's all very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga was saying, <div class="bookquote">``but I can't think where Jenny's got to.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) was standing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) seat and yelling `Bravo, bravo!'' (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>' said George. <div class="bookquote">``Then -- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>George faltered, <div class="bookquote">``then a boy came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) and they disappeared.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga asked anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``George, you're older than me. Tell me what I
<p/>am to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>). Look, I found this note this morning.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>George frowned thoughtfully as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) read the note. '' `Don't be afraid' means `don't do
<p/>as you're told','' Olga said. <div class="bookquote">``Oh, if I could only lay my hands on that boy I'd give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a
<p/>piece of my mind!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>Olga tucked the note away. They were silent for several moments. But the music
<p/>was so gay and everybody about them so merry that they soon linked hands again and
<p/>resumed their stroll.

<p/>Suddenly, at a crossing, they bumped into another couple walking along hand in
<p/>hand in an equally friendly fashion. It was Timur and Jenny.

<p/>Both couples were so taken aback that they greeted each other politely without
<p/>stopping.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga, clutching desperately at George's sleeve. <div class="bookquote">``That's the boy,''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>said George, abashed. <div class="bookquote">``And the worst part of it is that it is Timur, my own
<p/>daredevil of a nephew.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And you -- you knew!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga bristled. <div class="bookquote">``And never said a word to me!''




 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Shaking off his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) ran down the walk. But neither Timur nor Jenny was in
<p/>sight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) turned down a crooked little path and came upon Timur who was standing
<p/>facing Figure and Kvakin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) said, walking right up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``It's not enough that you sneak into
<p/>gardens and break trees, even old women's and the little orphaned girl's. It's not
<p/>enough that even the dogs run away from you. You're leading my sister astray and
<p/>turning her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) against me into the bargain. You may wear a Pioneer tie, but you're
<p/>nothing but a scoundrel!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>Timur turned pale.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You don't know anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>Olga made an impatient gesture and ran off to find Jenny.

<p/>Timur stood there and said nothing.

<p/>Figure and Kvakin could make nothing of it and they, too, were silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, Commissar?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>said Kvakin. <div class="bookquote">``I see you have your nasty moments too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Chief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>replied Timur, slowly raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">``I don't feel very happy right
<p/>now. I'd rather you had caught me and beaten the life out of me than have had to listen
<p/>to that on your account.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why'd you keep quiet?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>Kvakin sniggered. <div class="bookquote">``You could've said it was us and not
<p/>you. We were here all the time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>agreed Figure gleefully. <div class="bookquote">``You could've said that and we'd have given you a
<p/>sock on the jaw for it.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div><p/>But Kvakin, who had not expected this particular kind of support from Figure,
<p/>stared coldly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) friend. Meanwhile Timur slowly walked off, slapping the tree
<p/>trunks with his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) went.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)'s proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kvakin/Mikhail Kvakin</b></font>)</div>said Kvakin quietly. <div class="bookquote">``Wants to cry, but won't.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's give him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) something to cry about,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Figure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) hurled a fir cone at Timur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>)'s proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Kvakin repeated hoarsely. <div class="bookquote">``And you -- you're a stinker!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>)
<p/>swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) fist at Figure.

<p/>The Figure gaped, then let out a howl and bolted. Kvakin ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) and punched
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) twice in the back.

<p/>At last Kvakin stopped, picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) cap, hit it against his (<font color='blue'><b>Kvakin</b></font>) knee to shake off the
<p/>dust, went up to an ice cream vendor, bought a cone, leaned against a tree and,
<p/>breathing heavily, bit greedily into the ice cream.

<p/>Down by the rifle range Timur came upon Geika and Sima.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Timur!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sima Simakov/Simakov/Sima</b></font>)</div>Sima called. <div class="bookquote">``Your uncle's looking for you and he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) seems pretty mad.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, I'm going home.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Will you come back?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Timur!''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>said Geika with unexpected gentleness, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) comrade's hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter? We haven't done anyone any harm. And you know that when a
<p/>man's in the right. ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know -- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not afraid of anything in the world. But it doesn't prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<p/>getting hurt.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>Timur strode away.

<p/>Meanwhile Jenny ran up to Olga, who was carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) accordion home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Olga!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) sister. <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to talk to you any
<p/>more. I'm going to Moscow right away, and you can gad about till dawn with
<p/>whomever you like for all I care.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But Olga. ...''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to talk to you. The day after tomorrow we'll move back to Moscow.
<p/>And we'll wait for Dad there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes! I'll tell Dad, and not you -- I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dad</b></font>) everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Choking with tears of
<p/>rage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) ran off in search of Timur.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) found Geika and Simakov and asked them if they had seen Timur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)'s been called home,''  (<font color='red'><b>Geika</b></font>)</div>Geika said. <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) uncle's cross with him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) because of
<p/>something to do with you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny, now beside herself, stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) foot and clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) fists.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There's -- justice -- for you! ''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) arms around the trunk of a birch tree, but just then Tanya and Annie
<p/>rushed up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tanya</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tanya</b></font>)</div>cried Tanya. <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter? Come on, Jenny! An accordion player
<p/>has come and the dances have begun -- the girls are all there.''

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) and hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) and dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) over to the ring where frocks and
<p/>blouses bright as flowers could be seen whirling round and round.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny, don't cry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Annie</b></font>)</div>said Annie, speaking quickly, as usual, through clenched teeth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grandma hits me sometimes but I never cry! Come on, girls, let's get inside! Her-r-re
<p/>goes!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Her-r-re goes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny chimed in laughing imitation of Annie.

<p/>Breaking through the ring, they whirled and span in the gay abandon of the dance.



<p/>As soon as Timur came in, his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) uncle took him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm sick of your night adventures,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>George began. <div class="bookquote">``Sick of your signals, buzzers
<p/>and ropes. What was that strange business with the blanket?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That was a mistake.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Some mistake! And I'll ask you to leave that girl alone; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sister doesn't like you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I suppose you deserve it. What are these notes you've been writing?
<p/>What sort of peculiar dates have you been keeping in the garden at dawn? Olya says
<p/>you're making a hoodlum of the girl.''

<p/>anything she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doesn't understand, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could ask me. I'd tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good. But until you have told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), I forbid you to go near their house. And, in
<p/>general, if you don't do as you're told I'll ship you back to your mother instanter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) turned to go out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``When you were a boy what did you do? What did

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We? We used to run around, jump, climb roofs. Sometimes we fought. But our
<p/>games were all quite simple and everybody could understand them.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>To punish Jenny, Olga left for Moscow that evening without saying another word to
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) had nothing to do in Moscow, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) looked in on a friend of hers instead of
<p/>going straight home. It was almost ten by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) got to the flat and saw a
<p/>telegram pinned to the door.

<p/>Olga scanned the short message. It was from their father.




<p/>Toward evening, when the vans began to leave the park, Jenny and Tanya ran home.
<p/>Jenny wanted to change into gym-shoes for a game of volleyball.

<p/>Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) was tying her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) laces the mother of the fair-haired little girl entered the
<p/>room. The little girl lay asleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms.

<p/>The woman was crestfallen when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) learned that Olga was not at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to ask your sister if I could leave my girl here,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wasn't at home. The train arrives tonight, you see, and I have to be in Moscow to
<p/>meet my mother.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>said Jenny. <div class="bookquote">``What if Olga isn't here -- aren't I good enough?
<p/>Put her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) on my bed. I can sleep on the other one.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'s sleeping quietly now and won't wake up till morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>the mother said,
<p/>brightening. <div class="bookquote">``All you have to do is to take a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and straighten her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pillow now
<p/>and then.''

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>They undressed the little girl and put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to bed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother left. Jenny pulled back
<p/>the curtains so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could see the bed from outside, and closed the door. Then the
<p/>two girls dashed off to play volleyball, having settled that they would take turns
<p/>running back to look at the child.

<p/>They had no sooner gone than a postman came up to the porch. He (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) knocked for a
<p/>long time, and since there was no answer he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) crossed over to the neighbour's to inquire
<p/>whether the people who lived in the cottage had moved back to town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the neighbour</b></font>)</div>the neighbour said. <div class="bookquote">``The girl was here a moment ago. I can give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the
<p/>telegram.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The neighbour</b></font>)</div><p/>The neighbour signed for the telegram, put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) pocket, sat down on a bench, lit
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) pipe, and waited for Jenny.

<p/>An hour and a half later the postman came round again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here's another one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``What's all the fuss about? Be a good fellow and sign
<p/>for this telegram too.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The neighbour</b></font>)</div><p/>The neighbour signed the book. It was quite dark now. He (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) opened the gate, went up
<p/>the steps to the porch and glanced through the window. Inside, a little girl was asleep,
<p/>with a tawny kitten curled up by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. That meant the owners were not far away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>postman</b></font>) opened the top window and shoved the two telegrams through. They fell neatly
<p/>onto the windowsill, where Jenny was certain to notice them at once.

<p/>But Jenny did not notice them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) came in, adjusted the child's pillow by the light
<p/>of the moon, chased off the kitten, undressed and went to bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) lay for a long time
<p/>thinking about Life! It wasn't her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) fault, and it didn't seem to be Olga's either, yet there
<p/>they were, having their first big quarrel.

<p/>Jenny was sad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could not fall asleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) decided to eat a slice of bread and
<p/>jam. Jumping out of bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) ran over to the cupboard, switched on the light -- and
<p/>saw the telegrams on the windowsill.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) heart missed a beat. With trembling fingers she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) tore open the telegrams.

<p/>The first read:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will stop over en route midnight to three in morning. Wait for me town flat.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The second read:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come immediately. Dad will be in town tonight. Olga.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny glanced at the clock with a sinking heart. It was a quarter to twelve. Pulling
<p/>on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) dress and picking up the sleeping child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) dashed out onto the porch like one
<p/>possessed. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) put the child back in bed, ran out of the




<p/>house and made for the milkwoman's house. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) pounded on the door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)
<p/>fists and heels until the milkwoman's neighbour poked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) head out of the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What are you knocking for?''  (<font color='red'><b>the neighbour</b></font>)</div>the neighbour asked in a sleepy voice. <div class="bookquote">``What are you
<p/>up to now?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please, I'm not up to anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny pleaded. <div class="bookquote">``I must see Aunt Masha, the
<p/>milkwoman. I have to leave a baby with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>).''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rubbish!''  (<font color='red'><b>the neighbour</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the neighbour, shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) window with a bang. <div class="bookquote">``The old
<p/>woman left this morning to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother in the village.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A train pulling into the station blew its whistle. Jenny ran back into the road and
<p/>bumped into the elderly gentleman, the doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me what train that is?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>The old gentleman produced his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watch.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The eleven fifty-five,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">``The last train to Moscow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean, the last?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>whispered Jenny, a lump rising in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) throat. <div class="bookquote">``When
<p/>does the next one leave?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The next one leaves in the morning, at three forty. What's the matter with you,
<p/>child?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inquired solicitously, catching the reeling girl by the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``You're
<p/>crying? Can I help you in any way?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, you can't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>said Jenny, choking back her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) tears and rushing away. <div class="bookquote">``Nobody
<p/>in the world can help me now!''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At home she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) flung herself down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) bed, but the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sprang up and
<p/>glared at the sleeping child. Then, pulling herself together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) straightened the little
<p/>girl's blanket and whisked the tawny kitten off the pillow.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) switched on the lights on the porch, in the kitchen and in the living-room, sat
<p/>down on the sofa and began to rock her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) sat that way for a long time,
<p/>thinking about nothing in particular. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) accidentally touched the accordion which
<p/>was lying by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) side. Lifting it up mechanically, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) began to finger the keys. A sad,
<p/>solemn melody filled the room. Jenny abruptly laid the accordion aside and went over
<p/>to the window. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) shoulders were shaking.

<p/>No! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could not stay there alone and bear such torture a minute longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) lit a
<p/>candle and stumbled through the garden toward the barn.

<p/>There was the loft, with its ropes, map, sacks and flags. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) lit the lantern, went
<p/>over to the wheel, found the right rope, hooked it on, and then jerked the wheel.



<p/>Timur was fast asleep when Rita touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) shoulder with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) paw. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) did not feel
<p/>the gentle push. Rita then fastened her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) teeth into the blanket and dragged it off him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)
<p/>onto the floor.

<p/>Timur sat up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) asked, perplexed. <div class="bookquote">``Anything wrong?''

 (<font color='red'><b>The dog</b></font>)</div><p/>The dog gazed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) eyes, wagged her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) tail and tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rita</b></font>) head. At that moment
<p/>Timur heard the little bronze bell tinkling.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) went out onto the porch and picked up the receiver, wondering who could want
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) at that time of night.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, Timur listening. Who is it? You? Is that you, Jenny?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>At first Timur listened calmly. Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) lips began to twitch and the blood rushed to
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) was breathing hard.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``And only for three hours?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) asked agitatedly. <div class="bookquote">``Jenny, you're not crying, are you?
<p/>I can hear you -- you are crying. You mustn't! Don't! I'll come right away!''




 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) hung up and snatched a timetable from the shelf.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, there it is, the last one's at 23:55. The next one leaves at 3:40.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) stood there
<p/>biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">``Too late! Couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) do something? No! Too late!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>But a red star shone day and night over the gate of Jenny's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) had lit it
<p/>himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) own hand, and its rays glittered straight and sharp before his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>An Army officer's daughter was in trouble! An Army officer's daughter was in need
<p/>of help!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) dressed hastily and ran out. A few minutes later he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was standing on the porch of
<p/>the old gentleman's house. The light was still on in the doctor's room. Timur knocked
<p/>at the door. It was opened by the surprised doctor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) asked drily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd like to talk to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>replied Timur.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me?''  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div>The old gentleman reflected a moment, then opened the door wide with a
<p/>flourish and said, <div class="bookquote">``In that case, please come in.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>They did not talk long.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all we've been doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur wound up with flashing eyes. <div class="bookquote">``That's all we've
<p/>been doing and that's how we've been playing. That's why I need your Nick now.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man rose without a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took Timur abruptly by the chin, tilted back
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) head, looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) eyes, and then left the room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) entered Nick's bedroom and tugged at the boy's shoulder.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``You're wanted.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I haven't done anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div>Nick babbled, his (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) eyes rolling in fear. <div class="bookquote">``Honest, Grandpa,
<p/>I haven't done anything.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the old gentleman repeated shortly. <div class="bookquote">``Your comrade has come for you.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny was sitting on a pile of straw in the loft, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) arms clasped around her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) knees,
<p/>waiting for Timur. But instead of Timur, what should come poking through the
<p/>window but Nick's tousled head!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nick/Kolokolchikov/Nick Kolokolchikov</b></font>)</div>replied Nick in a low, frightened voice. <div class="bookquote">``I was sleeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) came. I
<p/>got up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) sent me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) told me to tell you to come down to the gate.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What for?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. I'm all dizzy myself. I can't make head or tail of it, Jenny.''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no one of whom to ask permission. His (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) uncle was in Moscow. Timur lit
<p/>a lantern, picked up an axe, called the dog, and went out into the garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) stopped
<p/>in front of the door of the shed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) eyes shifted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) axe to the padlock. Yes! He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>)
<p/>knew that it was wrong, but there was no other way out. A well-aimed hit broke the
<p/>padlock, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) wheeled the motorcycle out of the shed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rita!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) exclaimed sadly, kneeling to kiss the dog on the nose. <div class="bookquote">``Don't be angry! I
<p/>couldn't help it.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny and Nick were waiting at the gate. A light bore down on them swiftly from a
<p/>distance. They heard the chugging of a motor, then screwed up their eyes and backed
<p/>up against the fence as they were caught in a glaring headlight. Suddenly, the light
<p/>went out, the motor was shut off and they saw it was Timur.




<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nick,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) began, without saying hello or asking any questions. <div class="bookquote">``You stay here and
<p/>guard the little girl asleep in the house. You'll answer for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the company. Jenny,
<p/>hop on. We're off! To Moscow!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny squealed delightedly, hugged Timur with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) might and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hop on, Jenny, hop on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur shouted, trying to look stem. <div class="bookquote">``Hold on tight! Off
<p/>we go! Forward!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The motor snorted, the horn honked and soon the red tail light was lost from view.

<p/>Nick, completely dazed, picked up a stick, and, holding it as though it were a rifle,
<p/>tramped around the brightly lit cottage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Nick</b></font>) muttered, pacing importantly up and down. <div class="bookquote">``A soldier's life is certainly
<p/>tough! No peace, night or day!''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was getting on for three in the morning. Colonel Alexandrov was sitting at a table
<p/>on which was a pot of cold tea, some slices of salami sausage, cheese and bread.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have to go in half an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said to Olga. <div class="bookquote">``Pity I didn't get a chance to see
<p/>Jenny. Olya, are you crying?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hasn't come. I'm so sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) wanted to see you so
<p/>much. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'ll go right off her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) head. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'s crazy enough as it is!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Olga,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) father, getting up. <div class="bookquote">``Whatever you say I can't believe that Jenny
<p/>would mix with a bad crowd, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) could be led astray, or that anyone could
<p/>order her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) about. No! It isn't like her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``There you go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga reproachfully. <div class="bookquote">``You'll be telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) that next. As it is I
<p/>hear enough about her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) taking after you. But you're wrong this time! Would you
<p/>believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) climbed onto the roof and let a rope down through the chimney. Just as I
<p/>was about to start ironing, the iron hopped out of my hand and went sailing up the
<p/>chimney. Dad, when you left she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) had four frocks. Two are already in tatters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) grew
<p/>out of the third and I won't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) wear the fourth. I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) three new frocks myself
<p/>but they never last more'n a few days. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'s always covered with scratches and blue
<p/>marks.

<p/>And when you talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) purses her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) lips and opens her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) blue eyes wide. Of
<p/>course, everybody thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'s a pretty little flower, hardly a girl at all. But just try and
<p/>touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)! Some flower! More like a stinging nettle! Dad, don't you go thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)
<p/>takes after you. If you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'ll be so full of herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'ll go dancing round
<p/>the chimney-pots for three days running!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>agreed her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) father, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) a hug. <div class="bookquote">``I'll talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>). I'll write her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) a letter.
<p/>But you mustn't be too strict with her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>), Olga. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) dearly, that I think of
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>), that we'll soon be back and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) mustn't cry, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'s an officer's
<p/>daughter.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>)'ll cry all the same,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga, nestling close to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I'm also an officer's
<p/>daughter, and I'll cry too.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) father glanced at the clock, walked over to the mirror,
<p/>put on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) belt and straightened his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tunic.

<p/>Suddenly the outside door opened and shut with a bang. The hangings over the
<p/>doorway were pulled aside and Jenny appeared, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) shoulders hunched forward as
<p/>though she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) were about to make a leap.

<p/>But instead of crying out or springing forward she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) glided noiselessly across the
<p/>room and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) face on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) father's chest without uttering a sound.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) forehead was spattered with mud, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) crumpled dress all stained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jenny, what does it mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga asked anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``How did you get here?''




 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Without turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) head, Jenny waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) hand as much as to say: <div class="bookquote">``Wait a
<p/>moment! Leave me alone! Don't ask questions!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny's father picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) up, sat down on the sofa and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lap. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked
<p/>at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) face and wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) spattered forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) palm. <div class="bookquote">``Well done, Jenny! Good
<p/>girl!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``But you're all covered with mud -- your face is black! How did you get here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga
<p/>asked again.

<p/>Jenny pointed to the hangings at the door, and Olga saw Timur standing there.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) was pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) leather driving gloves. His (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) temple was smeared with yellow
<p/>grease. His (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) face was moist and tired, the face of a working man who has done his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) job
<p/>well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) head in greeting.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>cried Jenny, jumping from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) father's lap and running over to Timur. <div class="bookquote">``Don't
<p/>you believe anyone! They don't know anything. This is Timur -- my very good
<p/>comrade.''

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) father rose and, without hesitation, shook Timur's hand. A triumphant smile
<p/>flitted over Jenny's face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) flashed a quick, searching look at Olga, who, still quite
<p/>baffled, went up to Timur:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, hello, then...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>Soon the clock struck three.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny said anxiously. <div class="bookquote">``Are you going already? Our clock is fast.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Jenny, that's the correct time.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dad, your watch is fast too.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) ran over to the telephone and dialled the time. A
<p/>measured metallic voice answered:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The time is now four minutes past three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div><p/>Jenny glanced at the clock on the wall and sighed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It's fast, but only one minute fast. Dad, take us to the station with you; we'll see
<p/>you off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry, Jenny, I can't. I'll be much too busy.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? You've got your ticket already, haven't you?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``In a first-class sleeper?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in a first-class sleeper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, how I'd love to travel far, far away with you in a first-class sleeper! ''



 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not a regular station but a sort of shunting yard where the trains halted before
<p/>being switched onto their right lines. There were tracks, switches, trains and
<p/>carriages -- but no passengers. An armoured train was drawn up at the platform. An
<p/>iron window opened and, for a second, the face of the engine-driver was visible in the
<p/>light of the fire-box.

<p/>Jenny's father, Colonel Alexandrov, stood on the platform in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) leather coat. A
<p/>lieutenant came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), saluted and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Comrade Colonel, may we start?''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>The colonel</b></font>)</div>The colonel glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) watch: three fifty-three. <div class="bookquote">``The orders are to leave
<p/>at three fifty- three.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>Colonel Alexandrov went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) carriage and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). It was growing
<p/>light, but the sky was overcast. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) turned the moist handle and the heavy door opened.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) foot on the step he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) smiled and said to himself:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a first-class sleeper?''




 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, in a first-class sleeper.''

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The heavy steel door shut behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) with a thud.

<p/>Smoothly, without jerking or creaking, the armoured giant went into motion and
<p/>steadily picked up speed.

<p/>The engine glided past, then the gun turrets. Moscow was left behind. Mist was
<p/>rising. The stars faded. Day was breaking.



<p/>Finding both Timur and the motorcycle gone when he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) returned from town in the
<p/>morning, George decided to send Timur back to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother then and there.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had just sat down to write the letter when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) glanced through the window and
<p/>saw a soldier coming up the gravel walk.

<p/>The soldier produced an envelope.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Comrade Garayev?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Garayev</b></font>) asked.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Please sign for this envelope.''

 (<font color='red'><b>The soldier</b></font>)</div><p/>The soldier left. George inspected the envelope and whistled significantly.

<p/>Yes! Here it was, what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been waiting for so long!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) opened the envelope, read the message inside and then crumpled up the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
<p/>had begun to write. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did not have to send Timur home, but to send a wire to
<p/>the boy's mother asking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to come out to them.

<p/>Just then Timur entered the room. At the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) George brought his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fist down
<p/>on the table furiously. In Timur's wake came Olga and Jenny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>said Olga. <div class="bookquote">``There's no need to shout or bang the table. It's not Timur's
<p/>fault. It's your fault, and mine too. ''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That's right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>said Jenny. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you dare shout at him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>). Olga, don't touch the table.
<p/>That revolver of theirs makes an awful noise when it goes off.''

 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>George looked at Jenny, then at the revolver, then at the chipped clay ashtray. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)
<p/>began to see the light.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``So it was you who slept here that night, Jenny?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was I. Olga, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) all about it while Timur and I get some kerosene and a
<p/>cloth and clean up the bike.''



 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>Olga was sitting on the porch the following day when an Army officer came in
<p/>through the gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) walked with a confident stride, like a man returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) own
<p/>home. Olga, perplexed, rose to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).

<p/>George stood in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) in the uniform of a captain of the tank corps.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's this?''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga asked softly. <div class="bookquote">``A new part in your opera?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>replied George. <div class="bookquote">``I've dropped in to say goodbye. This isn't a new part -- it's
<p/>just a new uniform.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga asked, pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) insignia and blushing slightly, <div class="bookquote">``what you
<p/>meant the other day when you said `We strike through iron -- and through reinforced
<p/>concrete -- straight to the heart'?''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, this is it. Sing me something, Olga, something for me to take away on my
<p/>long, long journey.''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat down. Olga picked up her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) accordion.



<p/>Airmen all and pilots! Bombers all and fighters!




<p/>Now you've taken off for far away.

<p/>When will you come back to me?

<p/>I cannot tell when it will be

<p/>Only -- come back! Any time -- on any day... .

<p/>Good luck, wherever you may be,

<p/>On the ground, above the sea

<p/>Or flying far aloft through foreign skies --

<p/>Where'er you roam
<p/>May your two wings bravely bear
<p/>Their red stars so bright and dear
<p/>And may they bear you back to me.

<p/>Back home!

<p/><div class="bookquote">``There,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``But it's all about flyers. I don't know any good songs about
<p/>tankmen.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It doesn't matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>George said. <div class="bookquote">``See if you can't say something nice to me -- and
<p/>forget about the songs.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/>Plunged in thought, seeking the right good word, Olga gazed quietly and intently
<p/>into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grey, no longer laughing eyes.



<p/>Jenny, Timur and Tanya were in the garden.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>suggested Jenny. <div class="bookquote">``George is leaving. Let's get the whole company to see
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) off. Let's send out the No. 1 general rally signal. Won't it cause a commotion
<p/>though!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, better not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Better not. We didn't see anyone else off like that.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, all right, if we oughtn't to, we won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>agreed Jenny. <div class="bookquote">``You sit here while I go
<p/>and get a drink.''

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) left Tanya burst out laughing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>asked Timur.

<p/>Tanya laughed all the louder. <div class="bookquote">``There's a clever girl for you! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s a sly one, our
<p/>Jenny! I'll go and get a drink,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) say!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' `Ten-shun!'' Jenny's voice rang out triumphantly from the loft. <div class="bookquote">``Here goes No. 1
<p/>general rally signal!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>)'s mad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div>Timur sprang up. <div class="bookquote">``That'll fetch up a hundred chaps! What are you
<p/>doing?!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But the heavy wheel had already creaked and turned, the ropes had jerked and
<p/>pulled: <div class="bookquote">``three-stop, three-stop, stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And under the roofs of sheds, in attics and in
<p/>chicken coops the signal buzzers, bottles, tin cans and rattles rang, banged and
<p/>clattered.

<p/>If not a hundred, at least fifty youngsters came charging into the garden in response
<p/>to the familiar signal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Olga!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny flew up onto the porch. <div class="bookquote">``We're going to see George off too! There's a
<p/>lot of us. Take a look.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oho!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Garayev</b></font>)</div>exclaimed George in surprise. <div class="bookquote">``You've got a big company there. Big enough
<p/>to be loaded onto a train and sent off to the front.''




 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Can't be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jenny</b></font>)</div>Jenny sighed, repeating Timur's words. <div class="bookquote">``All the officers and other
<p/>bosses have strict orders to kick out all the kids. It's a shame! I could fit in somewhere
<p/>too -- take part in a battle, in an attack. Machine-guns forward! Number one!...''

 (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Number one braggart in the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga teased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) fixed the strap of the
<p/>accordion over her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) shoulder and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, if we're going to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) off, let's do it properly, music and all!''

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>They trooped out into the road. Olga played her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) accordion, and an orchestra of
<p/>bottles, tin cans, glass jars and sticks stepped out in front and struck up a lively
<p/>accompaniment.

<p/>They tramped down the green streets, their ranks growing as they marched along.
<p/>At first people could not understand what all the noise and the singing was about. But
<p/>as soon as they were told they smiled, and called out to wish George good luck.

<p/>As they approached the platform an army train swept by.

<p/>The first carriages were full of soldiers. The crowd waved and called out to them.
<p/>Then came flat-cars with a whole forest of green-shafted army carts. Then horseboxes.
<p/>The horses tossed their heads and chewed hay. They, also, were greeted with
<p/><div class="bookquote">``hurrahs'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>. Finally came a flatcar bearing a large, angular object covered over with
<p/>grey tarpaulin. Standing by it and swaying with the motion of the train was a sentry.

<p/>The troop train disappeared and a passenger train pulled in. Timur said good-bye to
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>Olga went up to George.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Will it be for long?''

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head and gripped her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Let's hope not!''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The whistle blew. The orchestra blared. The train pulled out.

<p/>Olga stood lost in thought.

<p/>In Jenny's eyes there shone a great happiness, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) did not know why.

<p/>Timur was upset, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) tried to mask his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) emotions.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) said in a voice not quite his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) own, <div class="bookquote">``now I'm on my own, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And,
<p/>bracing his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) shoulders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``However, Mother will be coming tomorrow.''

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And what about <div class="bookquote">``And this?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What about me?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Jenny shouted, them?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenny</b></font>) pointed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) comrades, pointed to
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) red star.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't worry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Olga</b></font>)</div>Olga said to Timur, shaking herself out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) reverie. <div class="bookquote">``You've
<p/>always thought about others, and they'll do the same to you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>Timur/Timur Garayev/Garayev</b></font>)</div><p/>Timur raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) head.

<p/>Grand, straightforward lad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) answered exactly as might have been
<p/>expected.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) swept his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) eyes over his (<font color='blue'><b>Timur</b></font>) comrades, smiled, and said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I see everybody feels fine. Then I feel fine too!''
